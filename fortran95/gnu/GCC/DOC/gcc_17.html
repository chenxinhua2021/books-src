In addition to the file <TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.md'</TT>, a machine description
includes a C header file conventionally given the name
<TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.h'</TT>.  This header file defines numerous macros
that convey the information about the target machine that does not fit
into the scheme of the <TT>`.md'</TT> file.  The file <TT>`tm.h'</TT> should be
a link to <TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.h'</TT>.  The header file <TT>`config.h'</TT>
includes <TT>`tm.h'</TT> and most compiler source files include
<TT>`config.h'</TT>.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (<VAR>char</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1438"></A>
 
A C expression which determines whether the option <SAMP>`-<VAR>char</VAR>'</SAMP>
takes arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
option takes--zero, for many options.

By default, this macro is defined as
<CODE>DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE>, which handles the standard options
properly.  You need not define <CODE>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE> unless you
wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any redefinition
should call <CODE>DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE> and then check for
additional options.

<A NAME="IDX1439"></A>
<DT><CODE>WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (<VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which determines whether the option <SAMP>`-<VAR>name</VAR>'</SAMP>
takes arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
option takes--zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
<CODE>SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE> is used for multi-character option names.

By default, this macro is defined as
<CODE>DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE>, which handles the standard options
properly.  You need not define <CODE>WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE> unless you
wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any redefinition
should call <CODE>DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG</CODE> and then check for
additional options.

<A NAME="IDX1440"></A>
<DT><CODE>SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION (<VAR>char</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which determines whether the option <SAMP>`-<VAR>char</VAR>'</SAMP>
stops compilation before the generation of an executable.  The value is
boolean, non-zero if the option does stop an executable from being
generated, zero otherwise.

By default, this macro is defined as
<CODE>DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</CODE>, which handles the standard
options properly.  You need not define
<CODE>SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</CODE> unless you wish to add additional
options which affect the generation of an executable.  Any redefinition
should call <CODE>DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION</CODE> and then check
for additional options.

<A NAME="IDX1441"></A>
<DT><CODE>SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES</CODE>
<DD>
A string-valued C expression which enumerates the options for which
the linker needs a space between the option and its argument.

If this macro is not defined, the default value is <CODE>""</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1442"></A>
<DT><CODE>CPP_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the CPP.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1443"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_BUILTIN_SIZE_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the builtin macro
<CODE>__SIZE_TYPE__</CODE>.  The macro <CODE>__SIZE_TYPE__</CODE> must then be defined
by <CODE>CPP_SPEC</CODE> instead.

This should be defined if <CODE>SIZE_TYPE</CODE> depends on target dependent flags
which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it should not
be defined.

<A NAME="IDX1444"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_BUILTIN_PTRDIFF_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the builtin macro
<CODE>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</CODE>.  The macro <CODE>__PTRDIFF_TYPE__</CODE> must then be
defined by <CODE>CPP_SPEC</CODE> instead.

This should be defined if <CODE>PTRDIFF_TYPE</CODE> depends on target dependent flags
which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it should not
be defined.

<A NAME="IDX1445"></A>
<DT><CODE>SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to CPP.  By default, this macro is defined to pass the option
<SAMP>`-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__'</SAMP> to CPP if <CODE>char</CODE> will be treated as
<CODE>unsigned char</CODE> by <CODE>cc1</CODE>.

Do not define this macro unless you need to override the default
definition.

<A NAME="IDX1446"></A>
<DT><CODE>CC1_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to <CODE>cc1</CODE>.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the <CODE>cc1</CODE>.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1447"></A>
<DT><CODE>CC1PLUS_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to <CODE>cc1plus</CODE>.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the <CODE>cc1plus</CODE>.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1448"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate options
you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the assembler.
See the file <TT>`sun3.h'</TT> for an example of this.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1449"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_FINAL_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how to
run any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.
Normally, this is not needed.  See the file <TT>`mips.h'</TT> for
an example of this.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1450"></A>
<DT><CODE>LINK_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options you
give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1451"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIB_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Another C string constant used much like <CODE>LINK_SPEC</CODE>.  The difference
between the two is that <CODE>LIB_SPEC</CODE> is used at the end of the
command given to the linker.

If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that
loads the standard C library from the usual place.  See <TT>`gcc.c'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1452"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBGCC_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Another C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program
how and when to place a reference to <TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> into the
linker command line.  This constant is placed both before and after
the value of <CODE>LIB_SPEC</CODE>.

If this macro is not defined, the GNU CC driver provides a default that
passes the string <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> to the linker unless the <SAMP>`-shared'</SAMP>
option is specified.

<A NAME="IDX1453"></A>
<DT><CODE>STARTFILE_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Another C string constant used much like <CODE>LINK_SPEC</CODE>.  The
difference between the two is that <CODE>STARTFILE_SPEC</CODE> is used at
the very beginning of the command given to the linker.

If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
standard C startup file from the usual place.  See <TT>`gcc.c'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1454"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENDFILE_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
Another C string constant used much like <CODE>LINK_SPEC</CODE>.  The
difference between the two is that <CODE>ENDFILE_SPEC</CODE> is used at
the very end of the command given to the linker.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<A NAME="IDX1455"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_SPECS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in the
<TT>`specs'</TT> file that can be used in various specifications like
<CODE>CC1_SPEC</CODE>.

The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
containing a string constant, that defines the specification name, and a
string constant that provides the specification.

Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

<CODE>EXTRA_SPECS</CODE> is useful when an architecture contains several
related targets, which have various <CODE>..._SPECS</CODE> which are similar
to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to keep
these definitions.

For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use <CODE>EXTRA_SPECS</CODE> to
define either <CODE>_CALL_SYSV</CODE> when the System V calling sequence is
used or <CODE>_CALL_AIX</CODE> when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
used.

The <TT>`config/rs6000/rs6000.h'</TT> target file defines:


<PRE>
#define EXTRA_SPECS \
  { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },

#define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""
</PRE>

The <TT>`config/rs6000/sysv.h'</TT> target file defines:

<PRE>
#undef CPP_SPEC
#define CPP_SPEC \
"%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
%{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } %{mcall-aix: -D_CALL_AIX } \
%{!mcall-sysv: %{!mcall-aix: %(cpp_sysv_default) }} \
%{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"

#undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
#define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"
</PRE>

while the <TT>`config/rs6000/eabiaix.h'</TT> target file defines
<CODE>CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT</CODE> as:


<PRE>
#undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
#define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1456"></A>
<DT><CODE>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
<TT>`libgcc.a'</TT> itself and should not pass <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options to the
linker.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass
the argument <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> to tell the linker to do the search and will
pass <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options to it.

<A NAME="IDX1457"></A>
<DT><CODE>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
<TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass
the argument <SAMP>`-lgcc'</SAMP> to tell the linker to do the search.
This macro is similar to <CODE>LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL</CODE>, except that it does
not affect <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options.

<A NAME="IDX1458"></A>
<DT><CODE>LINK_COMMAND_SPEC</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant giving the complete command line need to execute the
linker.  When you do this, you will need to update your port each time a
change is made to the link command line within <TT>`gcc.c'</TT>.  Therefore,
define this macro only if you need to completely redefine the command
line for invoking the linker and there is no other way to accomplish
the effect you need.

<A NAME="IDX1459"></A>
<DT><CODE>MULTILIB_DEFAULTS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an array of
string to tell the driver program which options are defaults for this
target and thus do not need to be handled specially when using
<CODE>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</CODE>.

Do not define this macro if <CODE>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</CODE> is not defined in
the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
<CODE>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</CODE> are set by default.
See section <A HREF="gcc_19.html#SEC253">The Target Makefile Fragment</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1460"></A>
<DT><CODE>RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to tell <CODE>gcc</CODE> that it should only translate
a <SAMP>`-B'</SAMP> prefix into a <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> linker option if the prefix
indicates an absolute file name.

<A NAME="IDX1461"></A>
<DT><CODE>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for the executable files of the compiler.

<A NAME="IDX1462"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
<CODE>STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  <CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is not searched
when the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross
compiler.  If you define <CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>, then be sure to add it
to the list of directories used to find the assembler in <TT>`configure.in'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1463"></A>
<DT><CODE>STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/local/lib/'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for startup files such as <TT>`crt0.o'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1464"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after the
standard prefixes.  <CODE>MD_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is not searched when the
<SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
compiler.

<A NAME="IDX1465"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option is
used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

<A NAME="IDX1466"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_ENVIRONMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set environment
variables for programs called by the driver, such as the assembler and
loader.  The driver passes the value of this macro to <CODE>putenv</CODE> to
initialize the necessary environment variables.

<A NAME="IDX1467"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for local header files.  <CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
comes before <CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> in the search order.

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<TT>`/usr/local/include'</TT> or its replacement.

<A NAME="IDX1468"></A>
<DT><CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
system-specific directory to search for header files before the standard
directory.  <CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> comes before
<CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> in the search order.

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the directory
specified.

<A NAME="IDX1469"></A>
<DT><CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override the
standard choice of <TT>`/usr/include'</TT> as the default prefix to
try when searching for header files.

Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
<TT>`/usr/include'</TT> or its replacement.

<A NAME="IDX1470"></A>
<DT><CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_COMPONENT</CODE>
<DD>
The "component" corresponding to <CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>.
See <CODE>INCLUDE_DEFAULTS</CODE>, below, for the description of components.
If you do not define this macro, no component is used.

<A NAME="IDX1471"></A>
<DT><CODE>INCLUDE_DEFAULTS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default search path
for include files.  For a native compiler, the default search path
usually consists of <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>,
<CODE>SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, <CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>, and
<CODE>STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>.  In addition, <CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>
and <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> are defined automatically by <TT>`Makefile'</TT>,
and specify private search areas for GCC.  The directory
<CODE>GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE> is used only for C++ programs.

The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
string constant), the component name, and flag for C++-only directories,
and a flag showing that the includes in the directory don't need to be
wrapped in <CODE>extern <SAMP>`C'</SAMP></CODE> when compiling C++.  Mark the end of
the array with a null element.

The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is part of,
if any, in all upper-case letters.  For example, it might be <SAMP>`GCC'</SAMP>
or <SAMP>`BINUTILS'</SAMP>.  If the package is part of the a vendor-supplied
operating system, code the component name as <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.

For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:


<PRE>
#define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
{                                       \
  { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
  { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
  { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
  { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
  { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
}

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CPP_PREDEFINES</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1475"></A>
 
Define this to be a string constant containing <SAMP>`-D'</SAMP> options to
define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system.
These macros will be predefined unless the <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> option is
specified.

In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names are
made by appending <SAMP>`__'</SAMP> at the beginning and at the end.  These
<SAMP>`__'</SAMP> macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
predefined regardless of whether <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is specified.

For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:


<PRE>
"-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"
</PRE>

The result is to define the macros <CODE>__mc68000__</CODE>, <CODE>__sun__</CODE>
and <CODE>__unix__</CODE> unconditionally, and the macros <CODE>mc68000</CODE>,
<CODE>sun</CODE> and <CODE>unix</CODE> provided <SAMP>`-ansi'</SAMP> is not specified.

<A NAME="IDX1476"></A>
<DT><CODE>extern int target_flags;</CODE>
<DD>
This declaration should be present.

<A NAME="IDX1477"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1478"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_...</CODE>
<DD>
This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
enable or disable the use of optional features of the target machine.
For example, one machine description serves both the 68000 and
the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether it should
use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command argument works
by means of a macro <CODE>TARGET_68020</CODE> that tests a bit in
<CODE>target_flags</CODE>.

Define a macro <CODE>TARGET_<VAR>featurename</VAR></CODE> for each such option.
Its definition should test a bit in <CODE>target_flags</CODE>; for example:


<PRE>
#define TARGET_68020 (target_flags &#38; 1)
</PRE>

One place where these macros are used is in the condition-expressions
of instruction patterns.  Note how <CODE>TARGET_68020</CODE> appears
frequently in the 68000 machine description file, <TT>`m68k.md'</TT>.
Another place they are used is in the definitions of the other
macros in the <TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.h'</TT> file.

<A NAME="IDX1479"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE>
<DD>
This macro defines names of command options to set and clear
bits in <CODE>target_flags</CODE>.  Its definition is an initializer
with a subgrouping for each command option.

Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the option
name, a number, which contains the bits to set in
<CODE>target_flags</CODE>, and a second string which is the description
displayed by --help.  If the number is negative then the bits specified
by the number are cleared instead of being set.  If the description
string is present but empty, then no help information will be displayed
for that option, but it will not count as an undocumented option.  The
actual option name is made by appending <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> to the specified name.

One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
this grouping is the default value for <CODE>target_flags</CODE>.  Any
target options act starting with that value.

Here is an example which defines <SAMP>`-m68000'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-m68020'</SAMP>
with opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:


<PRE>

<DT><CODE>TARGET_OPTIONS</CODE>
<DD>
This macro is similar to <CODE>TARGET_SWITCHES</CODE> but defines names of command
options that have values.  Its definition is an initializer with a
subgrouping for each command option.

Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the fixed part
of the option name, the address of a variable, and a description string.
The variable, type <CODE>char *</CODE>, is set to the variable part of the
given option if the fixed part matches.  The actual option name is made
by appending <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> to the specified name.

Here is an example which defines <SAMP>`-mshort-data-<VAR>number</VAR>'</SAMP>.  If the
given option is <SAMP>`-mshort-data-512'</SAMP>, the variable <CODE>m88k_short_data</CODE>
will be set to the string <CODE>"512"</CODE>.


<PRE>
extern char *m88k_short_data;
#define TARGET_OPTIONS \
 { { "short-data-", &#38;m88k_short_data, "Specify the size of the short data section" } }
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1481"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_VERSION</CODE>
<DD>
This macro is a C statement to print on <CODE>stderr</CODE> a string
describing the particular machine description choice.  Every machine
description should define <CODE>TARGET_VERSION</CODE>.  For example:


<PRE>
#ifdef MOTOROLA
#define TARGET_VERSION \
  fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
#else
#define TARGET_VERSION \
  fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
#endif

<A NAME="IDX1482"></A>
<DT><CODE>OVERRIDE_OPTIONS</CODE>
<DD>
Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make sense on
a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
<CODE>OVERRIDE_OPTIONS</CODE> to take account of this.  This macro, if
defined, is executed once just after all the command options have been
parsed.

Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
<SAMP>`-O'</SAMP>.  That is what <CODE>OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS</CODE> is for.

<A NAME="IDX1483"></A>
<DT><CODE>OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (<VAR>level</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are performed for
various optimization levels.   This macro, if defined, is executed once
just after the optimization level is determined and before the remainder
of the command options have been parsed.  Values set in this macro are
used as the default values for the other command line options.

<VAR>level</VAR> is the optimization level specified; 2 if <SAMP>`-O2'</SAMP> is
specified, 1 if <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.

<VAR>size</VAR> is non-zero if <SAMP>`-Os'</SAMP> is specified and zero otherwise.

You should not use this macro to change options that are not
machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to enable
machine-specific optimizations.

<STRONG>Do not examine <CODE>write_symbols</CODE> in
this macro!</STRONG> The debugging options are not supposed to alter the
generated code.

<A NAME="IDX1484"></A>
<DT><CODE>CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a frame
pointer.  If this macro is defined, GNU CC will turn on the
<SAMP>`-fomit-frame-pointer'</SAMP> option whenever <SAMP>`-O'</SAMP> is specified.

<DT><CODE>BITS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1486"></A>
 
Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit in a
byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the value zero.
This means that bit-field instructions count from the most significant
bit.  If the machine has no bit-field instructions, then this must still
be defined, but it doesn't matter which value it is defined to.  This
macro need not be a constant.

This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
bytes or words; that is controlled by <CODE>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1487"></A>
<DT><CODE>BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte in a
word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a constant.

<A NAME="IDX1488"></A>
<DT><CODE>WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object, the
most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to both
memory locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes that the
order of words in memory is the same as the order in registers.  This
macro need not be a constant.

<A NAME="IDX1489"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBGCC2_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN is not constant.  This must be a
constant value with the same meaning as WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN, which will be
used only when compiling libgcc2.c.  Typically the value will be set
based on preprocessor defines.

<A NAME="IDX1490"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to have the value 1 if <CODE>DFmode</CODE>, <CODE>XFmode</CODE> or
<CODE>TFmode</CODE> floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it to
have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.

You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
multi-word integers.

<A NAME="IDX1491"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable storage
unit (byte); normally 8.

<A NAME="IDX1492"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>
Number of bits in a word; normally 32.

<A NAME="IDX1493"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>
Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the default is
<CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE> can have at run-time.

<A NAME="IDX1494"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>
Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.

<A NAME="IDX1495"></A>
<DT><CODE>MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>
<DD>
Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the default is
<CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
smallest value that <CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE> can have at run-time.

<A NAME="IDX1496"></A>
<DT><CODE>POINTER_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider than the
width of <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.  If it is not equal to the width of <CODE>Pmode</CODE>,
you must define <CODE>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1497"></A>
<DT><CODE>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is nonzero if pointers that need to be
extended from being <CODE>POINTER_SIZE</CODE> bits wide to <CODE>Pmode</CODE> are to
be zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.

You need not define this macro if the <CODE>POINTER_SIZE</CODE> is equal
to the width of <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1498"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_MODE (<VAR>m</VAR>, <VAR>unsignedp</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro to update <VAR>m</VAR> and <VAR>unsignedp</VAR> when an object whose type
is <VAR>type</VAR> and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
stored in a register.  This macro is only called when <VAR>type</VAR> is a
scalar type.

On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on a full
register, define this macro to set <VAR>m</VAR> to <CODE>word_mode</CODE> if
<VAR>m</VAR> is an integer mode narrower than <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>.  In most
cases, only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their narrower
counterparts.

For most machines, the macro definition does not change <VAR>unsignedp</VAR>.
However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially handle
either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For example, on
the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add instructions
sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines, set
<VAR>unsignedp</VAR> according to which kind of extension is more efficient.

Do not define this macro if it would never modify <VAR>m</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX1499"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS</CODE>

Define this macro if the promotion described by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>
should also be done for outgoing function arguments.

<A NAME="IDX1500"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the promotion described by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>
should also be done for the return value of functions.

If this macro is defined, <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> must perform the same
promotions done by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1501"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the promotion described by <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE>
should <EM>only</EM> be performed for outgoing function arguments or
function return values, as specified by <CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS</CODE>
and <CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</CODE>, respectively.

<A NAME="IDX1502"></A>
<DT><CODE>PARM_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
size of an integer.

<A NAME="IDX1503"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if there is a guaranteed alignment for the stack
pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C expression
for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  This value is used as a
default if PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY is not defined.

<A NAME="IDX1504"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression
for the desired alignment (measured in bits).  If STACK_BOUNDARY is
also defined, this macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger
than STACK_BOUNDARY.

<A NAME="IDX1505"></A>
If <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
to the specified boundary.  If <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> is defined and specifies
a less strict alignment than <CODE>PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY</CODE>, the stack may
be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.

<A NAME="IDX1506"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

<A NAME="IDX1507"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine, in bits.

<A NAME="IDX1508"></A>
<DT><CODE>MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to an
object that can be referenced in one operation, without disturbing any
nearby object.  Normally, this is <CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE>, but may be larger
on machines that don't have byte or half-word store operations.

<A NAME="IDX1509"></A>
<DT><CODE>BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this machine,
in bits.  If defined, this overrides <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE> for
structure fields only.

<A NAME="IDX1510"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (<VAR>field</VAR>, <VAR>computed</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
An expression for the alignment of a structure field <VAR>field</VAR> if the
alignment computed in the usual way is <VAR>computed</VAR>.  GNU CC uses
this value instead of the value in <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE> or
<CODE>BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT</CODE>, if defined, for structure fields only.

<A NAME="IDX1511"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this machine.
Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be specified using the
<CODE>__attribute__ ((aligned (<VAR>n</VAR>)))</CODE> construct.  If not defined,
the default value is <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1512"></A>
<DT><CODE>DATA_ALIGNMENT (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>basic-align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variables in
the static store.  <VAR>type</VAR> is the data type, and <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is
the alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

If this macro is not defined, then <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is used.

<A NAME="IDX1513"></A>
One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data to
make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause character
arrays to be word-aligned so that <CODE>strcpy</CODE> calls that copy
constants to character arrays can be done inline.

<A NAME="IDX1514"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (<VAR>constant</VAR>, <VAR>basic-align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a constant
that is being placed in memory.  <VAR>constant</VAR> is the constant and
<VAR>basic-align</VAR> is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
align the object.

If this macro is not defined, then <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is used.

The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
constants to be word aligned so that <CODE>strcpy</CODE> calls that copy
constants can be done inline.

<A NAME="IDX1515"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>basic-align</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a variables in
the local store.  <VAR>type</VAR> is the data type, and <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is
the alignment that the object would ordinarily have.  The value of this
macro is used instead of that alignment to align the object.

If this macro is not defined, then <VAR>basic-align</VAR> is used.

One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data to
make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

<A NAME="IDX1516"></A>
<DT><CODE>EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that follows an
empty field such as <CODE>int : 0;</CODE>.

Note that <CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE> also affects the alignment
that results from an empty field.

<A NAME="IDX1517"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE>
<DD>
Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a multiple of.
Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a multiple of this.

If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
<CODE>BITS_PER_UNIT</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1518"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to work
if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions will merely
go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

<A NAME="IDX1519"></A>
<DT><CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers handle
alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (<CODE>int</CODE>,
<CODE>short</CODE>, or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an ordinary
field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed within the
structure so that it would fit within such a field, not crossing a
boundary for it.

Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as <CODE>int</CODE>
would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be four
bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The compiler can
support such references if there are <SAMP>`insv'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`extv'</SAMP>, and
<SAMP>`extzv'</SAMP> insns that can directly reference memory.

The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
<CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE> as large as <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>.
Then every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
<CODE>STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY</CODE> that way, you must define
<CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE> to have a nonzero value.

If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying out
bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to investigate
what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this program:


<PRE>
struct foo1
{
  char x;
  char :0;
  char y;
};

struct foo2
{
  char x;
  int :0;
  char y;
};

main ()
{
  printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo1));
  printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
          sizeof (struct foo2));
  exit (0);
}
</PRE>

If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you would
get from <CODE>PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1520"></A>
<DT><CODE>BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED</CODE>
<DD>
Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
aligning a bitfield within the structure.

<A NAME="IDX1521"></A>
<DT><CODE>ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>computed</VAR>, <VAR>specified</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a type
(given by <VAR>type</VAR> as a tree node) when the size computed in the
usual way is <VAR>computed</VAR> and the alignment is <VAR>specified</VAR>.

The default is to round <VAR>computed</VAR> up to a multiple of <VAR>specified</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX1522"></A>
<DT><CODE>ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>computed</VAR>, <VAR>specified</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type (given
by <VAR>type</VAR> as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the usual
way is <VAR>computed</VAR> and the alignment explicitly specified was
<VAR>specified</VAR>.

The default is to use <VAR>specified</VAR> if it is larger; otherwise, use
the smaller of <VAR>computed</VAR> and <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX1523"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine modes of
this size or smaller can be used for structures and unions with the
appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined, <CODE>GET_MODE_BITSIZE
(DImode)</CODE> is assumed.

<A NAME="IDX1524"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (<VAR>save_level</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, an expression of type <CODE>enum machine_mode</CODE> that
specifies the mode of the save area operand of a
<CODE>save_stack_<VAR>level</VAR></CODE> named pattern (see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC182">Standard Pattern Names For Generation</A>).
<VAR>save_level</VAR> is one of <CODE>SAVE_BLOCK</CODE>, <CODE>SAVE_FUNCTION</CODE>, or
<CODE>SAVE_NONLOCAL</CODE> and selects which of the three named patterns is
having its mode specified.

You need not define this macro if it always returns <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.  You
would most commonly define this macro if the
<CODE>save_stack_<VAR>level</VAR></CODE> patterns need to support both a 32- and a
64-bit mode.

<A NAME="IDX1525"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_SIZE_MODE</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, an expression of type <CODE>enum machine_mode</CODE> that
specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
<CODE>allocate_stack</CODE> named pattern (see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC182">Standard Pattern Names For Generation</A>).

You need not define this macro if it always returns <CODE>word_mode</CODE>.
You would most commonly define this macro if the <CODE>allocate_stack</CODE>
pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

<A NAME="IDX1526"></A>
<DT><CODE>CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>overflow</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to validate the value <VAR>value</VAR> (of type
<CODE>double</CODE>) for mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  This means that you check whether
<VAR>value</VAR> fits within the possible range of values for mode
<VAR>mode</VAR> on this target machine.  The mode <VAR>mode</VAR> is always
a mode of class <CODE>MODE_FLOAT</CODE>.  <VAR>overflow</VAR> is nonzero if
the value is already known to be out of range.

If <VAR>value</VAR> is not valid or if <VAR>overflow</VAR> is nonzero, you should
set <VAR>overflow</VAR> to 1 and then assign some valid value to <VAR>value</VAR>.
Allowing an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce
incorrect assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to crash.

This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.

<A NAME="IDX1527"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>
A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target machine.
There are three defined values:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1528"></A>
 
This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default; there is no
need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.

<A NAME="IDX1529"></A>
<DT><CODE>VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>
This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.

<A NAME="IDX1530"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
<DD>
This code indicates any other format.
</DL>

The value of this macro is compared with <CODE>HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc_18.html#SEC251">The Configuration File</A>) to determine whether the target machine has the same
format as the host machine.  If any other formats are actually in use on
supported machines, new codes should be defined for them.

The ordering of the component words of floating point values stored in
memory is controlled by <CODE>FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE> for the target
machine and <CODE>HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN</CODE> for the host.

<A NAME="IDX1531"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</CODE>
<DD>
GNU CC supports two ways of implementing C++ vtables:  traditional or with
so-called "thunks".  The flag <SAMP>`-fvtable-thunk'</SAMP> chooses between them.
Define this macro to be a C expression for the default value of that flag.
If <CODE>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</CODE> is 0, GNU CC uses the traditional
implementation by default.  The "thunk" implementation is more efficient
(especially if you have provided an implementation of
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK</CODE>, see section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC222">Function Entry and Exit</A>), but is not binary
compatible with code compiled using the traditional implementation.  
If you are writing a new ports, define <CODE>DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS</CODE> to 1.

If you do not define this macro, the default for <SAMP>`-fvtable-thunk'</SAMP> is 0.

target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one quarter
of a word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded up
to one unit.)

<A NAME="IDX1539"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
Maximum number for the size in bits of the type <CODE>char</CODE> on the
target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
<CODE>CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <CODE>CHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE> can have at run-time.  This is
used in <CODE>cpp</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1540"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bits of the type <CODE>float</CODE> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

<A NAME="IDX1541"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bits of the type <CODE>double</CODE> on the
target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
words.

<A NAME="IDX1542"></A>
<DT><CODE>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bits of the type <CODE>long double</CODE> on
the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
words.

<A NAME="IDX1543"></A>
<DT><CODE>WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point format
supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you must specify a
value less than or equal to the value of <CODE>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>.
If you do not define this macro, the value of <CODE>LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
is the default.

<A NAME="IDX1544"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR</CODE>
<DD>
An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
<CODE>char</CODE> should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
always override this default with the options <SAMP>`-fsigned-char'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`-funsigned-char'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX1545"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to determine whether to give an <CODE>enum</CODE> type
only as many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value means all
<CODE>enum</CODE> types should be allocated like <CODE>int</CODE>.

If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.

<A NAME="IDX1546"></A>
<DT><CODE>SIZE_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for size values.  The typedef name <CODE>size_t</CODE> is defined using the
contents of the string.

The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate them with
spaces, and write first any length keyword, then <CODE>unsigned</CODE> if
appropriate, and finally <CODE>int</CODE>.  The string must exactly match one
of the data type names defined in the function
<CODE>init_decl_processing</CODE> in the file <TT>`c-decl.c'</TT>.  You may not
omit <CODE>int</CODE> or change the order--that would cause the compiler to
crash on startup.

If you don't define this macro, the default is <CODE>"long unsigned
int"</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1547"></A>
<DT><CODE>PTRDIFF_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef name
<CODE>ptrdiff_t</CODE> is defined using the contents of the string.  See
<CODE>SIZE_TYPE</CODE> above for more information.

If you don't define this macro, the default is <CODE>"long int"</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1548"></A>
<DT><CODE>WCHAR_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
for wide characters.  The typedef name <CODE>wchar_t</CODE> is defined using
the contents of the string.  See <CODE>SIZE_TYPE</CODE> above for more
information.

If you don't define this macro, the default is <CODE>"int"</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1549"></A>
<DT><CODE>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
characters.  This is used in <CODE>cpp</CODE>, which cannot make use of
<CODE>WCHAR_TYPE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1550"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
<CODE>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
largest value that <CODE>WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE</CODE> can have at run-time.  This is
used in <CODE>cpp</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1551"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_INT_SELECTORS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the type of Objective C selectors should be
<CODE>int</CODE>.

If this macro is not defined, then selectors should have the type
<CODE>struct objc_selector *</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1552"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_SELECTORS_WITHOUT_LABELS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the compiler can group all the selectors together
into a vector and use just one label at the beginning of the vector.
Otherwise, the compiler must give each selector its own assembler
label.

On certain machines, it is important to have a separate label for each
selector because this enables the linker to eliminate duplicate selectors.

<H3><A NAME="SEC205" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC205">Basic Characteristics of Registers</A></H3>

<P>
Registers have various characteristics.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1561"></A>
 
Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
numbers 0 through <CODE>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1</CODE>; thus, the first
pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
<CODE>FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1562"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1563"></A>
An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed purposes
all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not available for
general allocation.  These would include the stack pointer, the frame
pointer (except on machines where that can be used as a general
register when no frame pointer is needed), the program counter on
machines where that is considered one of the addressable registers,
and any other numbered register with a standard use.

This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated by
commas and surrounded by braces.  The <VAR>n</VAR>th number is 1 if
register <VAR>n</VAR> is fixed, 0 otherwise.

The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
the following one, may be overridden at run time either automatically,
by the actions of the macro <CODE>CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE</CODE>, or by
the user with the command options <SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-fcall-used-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fcall-saved-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX1564"></A>
<DT><CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1565"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1566"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1567"></A>
Like <CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE> but has 1 for each register that is
clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are not
available for general allocation of values that must live across
function calls.

If a register has 0 in <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE>, the compiler
automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on function
exit, if the register is used within the function.

<A NAME="IDX1568"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1569"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1570"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1571"></A>
A C expression that is non-zero if it is not permissible to store a
value of mode <VAR>mode</VAR> in hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR> across a
call without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that do not
preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.

<A NAME="IDX1572"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1573"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1574"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE</CODE>
<DD>
Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify four variables
<CODE>fixed_regs</CODE>, <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE>, <CODE>global_regs</CODE>
(these three are of type <CODE>char []</CODE>) and <CODE>reg_class_contents</CODE>
(of type <CODE>HARD_REG_SET</CODE>).
Before the macro is called <CODE>fixed_regs</CODE>, <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE>
and <CODE>reg_class_contents</CODE> have been initialized from 
<CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE>, <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> and
<CODE>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</CODE>, respectively,
<CODE>global_regs</CODE> has been cleared, and any <SAMP>`-ffixed-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-fcall-used-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-fcall-saved-<VAR>reg</VAR>'</SAMP> command
options have been applied.

This is necessary in case the fixed or call-clobbered registers depend
on target flags.

You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.

<A NAME="IDX1575"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1576"></A>
If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
<CODE>fixed_regs</CODE> and <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE> to 1 for each of the
registers in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define
the macro <CODE>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER</CODE> to return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> if it
is called with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.

(However, if this class is not included in <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> and all
of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid using
these registers when the target switches are opposed to them.)

<A NAME="IDX1577"></A>
<DT><CODE>NON_SAVING_SETJMP</CODE>
<DD>
If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
<CODE>setjmp</CODE> and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
<CODE>longjmp</CODE> fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
<CODE>setjmp</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1578"></A>
<DT><CODE>INCOMING_REGNO (<VAR>out</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This C
expression returns the register number as seen by the called function
corresponding to the register number <VAR>out</VAR> as seen by the calling
function.  Return <VAR>out</VAR> if register number <VAR>out</VAR> is not an
outbound register.

<A NAME="IDX1579"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTGOING_REGNO (<VAR>in</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.  This C
expression returns the register number as seen by the calling function
corresponding to the register number <VAR>in</VAR> as seen by the called
function.  Return <VAR>in</VAR> if register number <VAR>in</VAR> is not an inbound
register.

<A NAME="IDX1581"></A>

</P>
<P>
Registers are allocated in order.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>REG_ALLOC_ORDER</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1582"></A>
 
If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
numbers of hard registers in the order in which GNU CC should prefer
to use them (from most preferred to least).

If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered first
(all else being equal).

One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On such
machines, define <CODE>REG_ALLOC_ORDER</CODE> to be an initializer that lists
the highest numbered allocable register first.

<A NAME="IDX1583"></A>
<DT><CODE>ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to allocate
hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic block.

Store the desired register order in the array <CODE>reg_alloc_order</CODE>.
Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the next
register; and so on.

The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
<CODE>reg_alloc_order</CODE> before execution of the macro.

On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.
</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC207" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC207">How Values Fit in Registers</A></H3>

<P>
This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1584"></A>
 
A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers, starting
at register number <VAR>regno</VAR>, required to hold a value of mode
<VAR>mode</VAR>.

On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
definition of this macro is


<PRE>
#define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
   ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
    / UNITS_PER_WORD))
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1585"></A>
<DT><CODE>ALTER_HARD_SUBREG (<VAR>tgt_mode</VAR>, <VAR>word</VAR>, <VAR>src_mode</VAR>, <VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns an adjusted hard register number for 


<PRE>
(subreg:<VAR>tgt_mode</VAR> (reg:<VAR>src_mode</VAR> <VAR>regno</VAR>) <VAR>word</VAR>)
</PRE>

This may be needed if the target machine has mixed sized big-endian
registers, like Sparc v9.

<A NAME="IDX1586"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a value
of mode <VAR>mode</VAR> in hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR> (or in several
registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all registers
are equivalent, a suitable definition is


<PRE>
#define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1
</PRE>

You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed registers,
because the allocation mechanism considers them to be always occupied.

<A NAME="IDX1587"></A>
On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to reject
odd register numbers for such modes.

The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that the
<SAMP>`mov<VAR>mode</VAR>'</SAMP> instruction pattern support moves between the
register and other hard register in the same class and that moving a
value into the register and back out not alter it.

Since the same instruction used to move <CODE>word_mode</CODE> will work for
all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> to distinguish between these modes, provided
you define patterns <SAMP>`movhi'</SAMP>, etc., to take advantage of this.  This
is useful because of the interaction between <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>
and <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P</CODE>; it is very desirable for all integer modes
to be tieable.

Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed only
in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any registers that
can hold integers can safely <EM>hold</EM> a floating point machine
mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done on it in those
registers.  Integer move instructions can be used to move the values.

On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the floating
registers normalize any value stored in them, because storing a
non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE> should reject fixed-point machine modes in
floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not automatically
normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one and retrieve it
unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode may go in a floating
register, so you can define this macro to say so.

The primary significance of special floating registers is rather that
they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>.  You handle it by writing the proper
constraints for those instructions.

On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to access,
so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame than in such a
register if floating point arithmetic is not being done.  As long as the
floating registers are not in class <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>, they will not
be used unless some pattern's constraint asks for one.

<A NAME="IDX1588"></A>
<DT><CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<VAR>mode1</VAR>, <VAR>mode2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode
<VAR>mode1</VAR> is accessible in mode <VAR>mode2</VAR> without copying.

If <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>r</VAR>, <VAR>mode1</VAR>)</CODE> and
<CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (<VAR>r</VAR>, <VAR>mode2</VAR>)</CODE> are always the same for
any <VAR>r</VAR>, then <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P (<VAR>mode1</VAR>, <VAR>mode2</VAR>)</CODE>
should be nonzero.  If they differ for any <VAR>r</VAR>, you should define
this macro to return zero unless some other mechanism ensures the
accessibility of the value in a narrower mode.

You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
possible since doing so will allow GNU CC to perform better register
allocation.

<A NAME="IDX1589"></A>
<DT><CODE>AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from <CODE>CCmode</CODE>
registers.  You should only define this macro if support fo copying to/from
<CODE>CCmode</CODE> is incomplete.

<H3><A NAME="SEC208" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC208">Handling Leaf Functions</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1590"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1591"></A>
On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can run
more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.  Often this
means it is required to receive its arguments in the registers where they
are passed by the caller, instead of the registers where they would
normally arrive.

</P>
<P>
The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".

</P>
<P>
GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function is
suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>LEAF_REGISTERS</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1592"></A>
 
A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number, which
contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate for leaf
function treatment.

If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers, then the
registers marked here should be the ones before renumbering--those that
GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The registers which will actually be
used in the assembler code, after renumbering, should not be marked with 1
in this vector.

Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize
the treatment of leaf functions.

<A NAME="IDX1593"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEAF_REG_REMAP (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is the register number to which <VAR>regno</VAR>
should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf function.

If <VAR>regno</VAR> is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1, which
will cause the compiler to abort.

Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to optimize the
treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be renumbered to do
this.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1594"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1595"></A>
Normally, <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must
treat leaf functions specially.  They can test the C variable
<CODE>current_function_is_leaf</CODE> which is nonzero for leaf functions.
<CODE>current_function_is_leaf</CODE> is set prior to local register allocation
and is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can also test the C
variable <CODE>current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs</CODE> which is nonzero for
leaf functions which only use leaf registers.
<CODE>current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs</CODE> is valid after reload and is
only useful if <CODE>LEAF_REGISTERS</CODE> is defined.

<H3><A NAME="SEC209" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC209">Registers That Form a Stack</A></H3>

<P>
There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack, as in the 80387 coprocessor for the 80386.
Stack registers are normally written by pushing onto the stack, and are
numbered relative to the top of the stack.

<P>
These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used to

removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1599"></A>
 
If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
register number <VAR>regno</VAR> is an overlapping register.  This means a
hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different number.
(Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows a machine to
be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This macro must return
nonzero for <EM>all</EM> the registers which overlap each other.  GNU CC
can use an overlapping register only in certain limited ways.  It can
be used for allocation within a basic block, and may be spilled for
reloading; that is all.

If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard registers
overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.

<A NAME="IDX1600"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
the insn <VAR>insn</VAR> has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
contents of hard register number <VAR>regno</VAR>.  By "mysterious" we
mean that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.

If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers registers
mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else being equal,

<H2><A NAME="SEC211" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC211">Register Classes</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1601"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1602"></A>

</P>
<P>
On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.
For example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These machine
restrictions are described to the compiler using <STRONG>register classes</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and saying
which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify register classes
that are allowed as operands to particular instruction patterns.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1603"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1604"></A>
In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact, one
class must be named <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE> and contain all the registers.  Another
class must be named <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> and contain no registers.  Often the
union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not required.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1605"></A>
One of the classes must be named <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters
<SAMP>`r'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`g'</SAMP> specify this class.  If <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> is
the same as <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>, just define it as a macro which expands
to <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Order the classes so that if class <VAR>x</VAR> is contained in class <VAR>y</VAR>
then <VAR>x</VAR> has a lower class number than <VAR>y</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The way classes other than <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE> are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

</P>
<P>
You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register for a
certain operand, you should define a class <CODE>FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS</CODE>
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

</P>
<P>
You must also specify certain redundant information about the register
classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which ones are
contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class contained
in their union.

</P>
<P>
When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with <CODE>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer that
mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the operations for
single-byte values (<CODE>QImode</CODE>) are limited to certain registers.  When
this is so, each register class that is used in a bitwise-and or shift
instruction must have a subclass consisting of registers from which
single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This is so that
<CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> can always have a possible value to return.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>enum reg_class</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1606"></A>
 
An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class names
as enumeral values.  <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> must be first.  <CODE>ALL_REGS</CODE>
must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral value,
<CODE>LIM_REG_CLASSES</CODE>, which is not a register class but rather
tells how many classes there are.

Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
the class name to type <CODE>int</CODE>.  The number serves as an index
in many of the tables described below.

<A NAME="IDX1607"></A>
<DT><CODE>N_REG_CLASSES</CODE>
<DD>
The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:


<PRE>
#define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1608"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>
An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C string
constants.  These names are used in writing some of the debugging dumps.

<A NAME="IDX1609"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_CONTENTS</CODE>
<DD>
An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as integers
which are bit masks.  The <VAR>n</VAR>th integer specifies the contents of class
<VAR>n</VAR>.  The way the integer <VAR>mask</VAR> is interpreted is that
register <VAR>r</VAR> is in the class if <CODE><VAR>mask</VAR> &#38; (1 &#60;&#60; <VAR>r</VAR>)</CODE> is 1.

When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not suffice.
Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers, braced groupings containing
several integers.  Each sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer
for the type <CODE>HARD_REG_SET</CODE> which is defined in <TT>`hard-reg-set.h'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1610"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_REG_CLASS (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard register
<VAR>regno</VAR>.  In general there is more than one such class; choose a class
which is <STRONG>minimal</STRONG>, meaning that no smaller class also contains the
register.

<A NAME="IDX1611"></A>
<DT><CODE>BASE_REG_CLASS</CODE>
<DD>
A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an address
which is the register value plus a displacement.

<A NAME="IDX1612"></A>
<DT><CODE>INDEX_REG_CLASS</CODE>
<DD>
A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

<A NAME="IDX1613"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (<VAR>char</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters for register classes.  If <VAR>char</VAR> is such a letter, the
value should be the register class corresponding to it.  Otherwise,
the value should be <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>.  The register letter <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>,
corresponding to class <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>, will not be passed
to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

<A NAME="IDX1614"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which is nonzero if register number <VAR>num</VAR> is
suitable for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.

<A NAME="IDX1615"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>num</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is just like <CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P</CODE>, except that
that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
<VAR>mode</VAR>.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
reference affects whether a register may be used as a base register.  If
you define this macro, the compiler will use it instead of
<CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1616"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (<VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which is nonzero if register number <VAR>num</VAR> is
suitable for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
allocated such a hard register.

The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

<A NAME="IDX1617"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to copy value <VAR>x</VAR> into a register in class
<VAR>class</VAR>.  The value is a register class; perhaps <VAR>class</VAR>, or perhaps
another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following definition is
safe:


<PRE>
#define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS
</PRE>

Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.  For
example, on the 68000, when <VAR>x</VAR> is an integer constant that is in range
for a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> instruction, the value of this macro is always
<CODE>DATA_REGS</CODE> as long as <VAR>class</VAR> includes the data registers.
Requiring a data register guarantees that a <SAMP>`moveq'</SAMP> will be used.

If <VAR>x</VAR> is a <CODE>const_double</CODE>, by returning <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>
you can force <VAR>x</VAR> into a memory constant.  This is useful on
certain machines where immediate floating values cannot be loaded into
certain kinds of registers.

<A NAME="IDX1618"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE>, but for output reloads instead of
input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to use
<VAR>class</VAR>, unchanged.

<A NAME="IDX1619"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register class
to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of mode
<VAR>mode</VAR> in a reload register for which class <VAR>class</VAR> would
ordinarily be used.

Unlike <CODE>PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE>, this macro should be used when
there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload classes.

The value is a register class; perhaps <VAR>class</VAR>, or perhaps another,
smaller class.

Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations which
require the macro to do something nontrivial.

<A NAME="IDX1620"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1621"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1622"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly to or
from memory or even from other types of registers.  An example is the
<SAMP>`MQ'</SAMP> register, which on most machines, can only be copied to or
from general registers, but not memory.  Some machines allow copying all
registers to and from memory, but require a scratch register for stores
to some memory locations (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT,
and those with certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling
PIC).  In some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
required.

You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase that it may
need to allocate at least one register for a reload in addition to the
register to contain the data.  Specifically, if copying <VAR>x</VAR> to a
register <VAR>class</VAR> in <VAR>mode</VAR> requires an intermediate register,
you should define <CODE>SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> to return the
largest register class all of whose registers can be used as
intermediate registers or scratch registers.

If copying a register <VAR>class</VAR> in <VAR>mode</VAR> to <VAR>x</VAR> requires an
intermediate or scratch register, <CODE>SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE>
should be defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
<CODE>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</CODE> should be used instead of defining both
macros identically.

The values returned by these macros are often <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.
Return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE> if no spare register is needed; i.e., if <VAR>x</VAR>
can be directly copied to or from a register of <VAR>class</VAR> in
<VAR>mode</VAR> without requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this
macro if it would always return <CODE>NO_REGS</CODE>.

If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
intermediate register), you should define patterns for
<SAMP>`reload_in<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`reload_out<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP>, as required
(see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC182">Standard Pattern Names For Generation</A>.  These patterns, which will normally be
implemented with a <CODE>define_expand</CODE>, should be similar to the
<SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns, except that operand 2 is the scratch
register.

Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register that
contain a single register class.  If the original reload register (whose
class is <VAR>class</VAR>) can meet the constraint given in the pattern, the
value returned by these macros is used for the class of the scratch
register.  Otherwise, two additional reload registers are required.
Their classes are obtained from the constraints in the insn pattern.

<VAR>x</VAR> might be a pseudo-register or a <CODE>subreg</CODE> of a
pseudo-register, which could either be in a hard register or in memory.
Use <CODE>true_regnum</CODE> to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is
in memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

These macros should not be used in the case where a particular class of
registers can only be copied to memory and not to another class of
registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are not needed and
would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location must be used to perform
the copy and the <CODE>mov<VAR>m</VAR></CODE> pattern should use memory as a
intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between floating-point and
general registers.

<A NAME="IDX1623"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (<VAR>class1</VAR>, <VAR>class2</VAR>, <VAR>m</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be copied
to some other registers without using memory.  Define this macro on
those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if objects of mode
<VAR>m</VAR> in registers of <VAR>class1</VAR> can only be copied to registers of
class <VAR>class2</VAR> by storing a register of <VAR>class1</VAR> into memory
and loading that memory location into a register of <VAR>class2</VAR>.

Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

<A NAME="IDX1624"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Normally when <CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</CODE> is defined, the compiler
allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register copies.
If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the memory location
defined by this macro.

Do not define this macro if you do not define
<CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1625"></A>
<DT><CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy between two
registers of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>, it normally allocates sufficient memory to
hold a quantity of <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE> bits and performs the store and
load operations in a mode that many bits wide and whose class is the
same as that of <VAR>mode</VAR>.

This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that all
bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the registers
in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for floating-point
registers.

However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines, such as
the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point registers
differently than in integer registers.  On those machines, the default
widening will not work correctly and you must define this macro to
suppress that widening in some cases.  See the file <TT>`alpha.h'</TT> for
details.

Do not define this macro if you do not define
<CODE>SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED</CODE> or if widening <VAR>mode</VAR> to a mode that
is <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE> bits wide is correct for your machine.

<A NAME="IDX1626"></A>
<DT><CODE>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</CODE>
<DD>
On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across arbitrary
insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that require values
to be in specific registers (like an accumulator), and reload will fail
if the required hard register is used for another purpose across such an
insn.

Define <CODE>SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES</CODE> to be an expression with a non-zero
value on these machines.  When this macro has a non-zero value, the
compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of hard registers.

It is always safe to define this macro with a non-zero value, but if you
unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of optimizations
that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not define this macro
with a non-zero value when it is required, the compiler will run out of
spill registers and print a fatal error message.  For most machines, you
should not define this macro at all.

<A NAME="IDX1627"></A>
<DT><CODE>CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (<VAR>class</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been assigned
to registers of class <VAR>class</VAR> would likely be spilled because
registers of <VAR>class</VAR> are needed for spill registers.

The default value of this macro returns 1 if <VAR>class</VAR> has exactly one
register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default should be
used.  Only define this macro to some other expression if pseudos
allocated by <TT>`local-alloc.c'</TT> end up in memory because their hard
registers were needed for spill registers.  If this macro returns nonzero
for those classes, those pseudos will only be allocated by
<TT>`global.c'</TT>, which knows how to reallocate the pseudo to another
register.  If there would not be another register available for
reallocation, you should not change the definition of this macro since
the only effect of such a definition would be to slow down register
allocation.

<A NAME="IDX1628"></A>
<DT><CODE>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers
of class <VAR>class</VAR> needed to hold a value of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.

This is closely related to the macro <CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS</CODE>.  In fact,
the value of the macro <CODE>CLASS_MAX_NREGS (<VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
should be the maximum value of <CODE>HARD_REGNO_NREGS (<VAR>regno</VAR>,
<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE> for all <VAR>regno</VAR> values in the class <VAR>class</VAR>.

This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values
in the reload pass.

<DT><CODE>CLASS_CANNOT_CHANGE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression for a class that contains registers which the
compiler must always access in a mode that is the same size as the mode
in which it loaded the register.

For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects into
floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64-bits.
Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit object
does not store the low-order 32-bits, as would be the case for a normal
register.  Therefore, <TT>`alpha.h'</TT> defines this macro as
<CODE>FLOAT_REGS</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
Three other special macros describe which operands fit which constraint
letters.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1629"></A>
 
A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters (<SAMP>`I'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`J'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>, ... <SAMP>`P'</SAMP>) that specify
particular ranges of integer values.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is one of those
letters, the expression should check that <VAR>value</VAR>, an integer, is in
the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is
not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of
<VAR>value</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX1630"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand constraint
letters that specify particular ranges of <CODE>const_double</CODE> values
(<SAMP>`G'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`H'</SAMP>).

If <VAR>c</VAR> is one of those letters, the expression should check that
<VAR>value</VAR>, an RTX of code <CODE>const_double</CODE>, is in the appropriate
range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is not one of those
letters, the value should be 0 regardless of <VAR>value</VAR>.

<CODE>const_double</CODE> is used for all floating-point constants and for
<CODE>DImode</CODE> fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
or both kinds of values.  It can use <CODE>GET_MODE</CODE> to distinguish
between these kinds.

<A NAME="IDX1631"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (<VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>c</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent constraint
letters (<SAMP>`Q'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`R'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`S'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`T'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`U'</SAMP>) that can
be used to segregate specific types of operands, usually memory
references, for the target machine.  Normally this macro will not be
defined.  If it is required for a particular target machine, it should
return 1 if <VAR>value</VAR> corresponds to the operand type represented by
the constraint letter <VAR>c</VAR>.  If <VAR>c</VAR> is not defined as an extra
constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of <VAR>value</VAR>.

For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their output in r0 if
the memory reference contains a symbolic address.  Constraint letter
<SAMP>`Q'</SAMP> is defined as representing a memory address that does
<EM>not</EM> contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is specified with
a <SAMP>`Q'</SAMP> constraint on the input and <SAMP>`r'</SAMP> on the output.  The next
alternative specifies <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> on the input and a register class that
does not include r0 on the output.

<A NAME="IDX1633"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1634"></A>

</P>
<P>
Here is the basic stack layout.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1635"></A>
 
Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
pointer to a smaller address.

When we say, "define this macro if ...," it means that the
compiler checks this macro only with <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> so the precise
definition used does not matter.

<A NAME="IDX1636"></A>
<DT><CODE>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at negative
offsets from the frame pointer.

<A NAME="IDX1637"></A>
<DT><CODE>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy decreasing
addresses on the stack.

<A NAME="IDX1638"></A>
<DT><CODE>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to be allocated.

If <CODE>FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD</CODE>, find the next slot's offset by
subtracting the first slot's length from <CODE>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</CODE>.
Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to the
value <CODE>STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1639"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at which
outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the default value of
zero is used.  This is the proper value for most machines.

If <CODE>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</CODE>, this is the offset to the location above
the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

<A NAME="IDX1640"></A>
<DT><CODE>FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (<VAR>fundecl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
function.

If <CODE>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</CODE>, this is the offset to the location above
the first argument's address.

<A NAME="IDX1641"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (<VAR>fundecl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically allocated
on the stack, e.g., by <CODE>alloca</CODE>.

The default value for this macro is <CODE>STACK_POINTER_OFFSET</CODE> plus the
length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
machines.  See <TT>`function.c'</TT> for details.

<A NAME="IDX1642"></A>
<DT><CODE>DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (<VAR>frameaddr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a stack
frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.  Assume that
<VAR>frameaddr</VAR> is an RTL expression for the address of the stack frame
itself.

If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
of <VAR>frameaddr</VAR>---that is, the stack frame address is also the
address of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

<A NAME="IDX1643"></A>
<DT><CODE>SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code to
setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For example,
on the Sparc, we must flush all of the register windows to the stack
before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You will seldom need to
define this macro.

<A NAME="IDX1644"></A>
<DT><CODE>BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression that contains an rtx that is used to store
the address of the current frame into the built in <CODE>setjmp</CODE> buffer.
The default value, <CODE>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</CODE>, is correct for most
machines.  One reason you may need to define this macro is if
<CODE>hard_frame_pointer_rtx</CODE> is the appropriate value on your machine.

<A NAME="IDX1645"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_ADDR_RTX (<VAR>count</VAR>, <VAR>frameaddr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the return
address for the frame <VAR>count</VAR> steps up from the current frame, after
the prologue.  <VAR>frameaddr</VAR> is the frame pointer of the <VAR>count</VAR>
frame, or the frame pointer of the <VAR>count</VAR> - 1 frame if
<CODE>RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME</CODE> is defined.

The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
<VAR>count</VAR> is zero, but may be <CODE>NULL_RTX</CODE> if there is not way to
determine the return address of other frames.

<A NAME="IDX1646"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME</CODE>
<DD>
Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is accessed
from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.

<A NAME="IDX1647"></A>
<DT><CODE>INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before the
prologue.  This RTL is either a <CODE>REG</CODE>, indicating that the return
value is saved in <SAMP>`REG'</SAMP>, or a <CODE>MEM</CODE> representing a location in
the stack.

You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<A NAME="IDX1648"></A>
<DT><CODE>INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in bytes,
from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of the stack
frame at the beginning of any function, before the prologue.  The top of
the frame is defined to be the value of the stack pointer in the
previous frame, just before the call instruction.

You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<A NAME="IDX1649"></A>
<DT><CODE>ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in bytes,
from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address (cfa).  The
final value should coincide with that calculated by 
<CODE>INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET</CODE>.  Which is unfortunately not usable
during virtual register instantiation.

You only need to define this macro if you want to support call frame
debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

<H3><A NAME="SEC214" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC214">Specifying How Stack Checking is Done</A></H3>

<P>
GNU CC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of
the stack, if the <SAMP>`-fstack-check'</SAMP> is specified, in one of three ways:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

If the value of the <CODE>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</CODE> macro is nonzero, GNU CC
will assume that you have arranged for stack checking to be done at
appropriate places in the configuration files, e.g., in
<CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE>.  GNU CC will do not other special processing.

<LI>

If <CODE>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</CODE> is zero and you defined a named pattern
called <CODE>check_stack</CODE> in your <TT>`md'</TT> file, GNU CC will call that
pattern with one argument which is the address to compare the stack
value against.  You must arrange for this pattern to report an error if
the stack pointer is out of range.

<LI>

If neither of the above are true, GNU CC will generate code to periodically
"probe" the stack pointer using the values of the macros defined below.
</OL>

<P>
Normally, you will use the default values of these macros, so GNU CC
will use the third approach.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1650"></A>
 
A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration files in a
machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro if stack checking 
is require by the ABI of your machine or if you would like to have to stack 
checking in some more efficient way than GNU CC's portable approach.
The default value of this macro is zero.

<A NAME="IDX1651"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL</CODE>
<DD>
An integer representing the interval at which GNU CC must generate stack
probe instructions.  You will normally define this macro to be no larger
than the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a stack area.  The
default value of 4096 is suitable for most systems.

<A NAME="IDX1652"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_PROBE_LOAD</CODE>
<DD>
A integer which is nonzero if GNU CC should perform the stack probe 
as a load instruction and zero if GNU CC should use a store instruction.
The default is zero, which is the most efficient choice on most systems.

<A NAME="IDX1653"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_PROTECT</CODE>
<DD>
The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack overflow,
for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The default value of
75 words should be adequate for most machines.

<A NAME="IDX1654"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GNU CC will generate probe
instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this many bytes of
stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger than this size, stack
checking will not be reliable and GNU CC will issue a warning.  The
default is chosen so that GNU CC only generates one instruction on most
systems.  You should normally not change the default value of this macro.

<A NAME="IDX1655"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
GNU CC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not including
space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and user variables.
You need only specify an upper bound for this amount and will normally
use the default of four words.

<A NAME="IDX1656"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GNU CC will place in the
fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies

GNU CC computed the default from the values of the above macros and you will
normally not need to override that default.

<A NAME="IDX1657"></A>
 
The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also be a

the hardware determines which register this is.

<A NAME="IDX1658"></A>
<DT><CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to

choose any register you wish for this purpose.

<A NAME="IDX1659"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers are
between these two locations).  On those machines, define
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> the number of a special, fixed register to
be used internally until the offset is known, and define
<CODE>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> to be the actual hard register number
used for the frame pointer.

You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances when it
is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame pointer and
the automatic variables until after register allocation has been
completed.  When this macro is defined, you must also indicate in your
definition of <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE> how to eliminate
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE> into either <CODE>HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>

Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1660"></A>
<DT><CODE>ARG_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to access
the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is the same as the
frame pointer register.  On some machines, the hardware determines which
register this is.  On other machines, you can choose any register you
wish for this purpose.  If this is not the same register as the frame
pointer register, then you must mark it as a fixed register according to
<CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE>, or arrange to be able to eliminate it
(see section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC216">Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer</A>).

<A NAME="IDX1661"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
The register number of the return address pointer register, which is used to
access the current function's return address from the stack.  On some
machines, the return address is not at a fixed offset from the frame
pointer or stack pointer or argument pointer.  This register can be defined
to point to the return address on the stack, and then be converted by
<CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE> into either the frame pointer or stack pointer.

Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the return
address from the stack.

Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain pointer.  If
register windows are used, the register number as seen by the called
function is <CODE>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM</CODE>, while the register
number as seen by the calling function is <CODE>STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM</CODE>.  If
these registers are the same, <CODE>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM</CODE> need
not be defined.
The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

<CODE>STATIC_CHAIN</CODE> and <CODE>STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING</CODE> give the locations

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1669"></A>
 
A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a frame
pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.  If its value is
nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

The expression can in principle examine the current function and decide
according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0 or the
constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to be generated
with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time or space.  Use 1
when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a frame pointer.

In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid code
without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases and
automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of what
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> says.  You don't need to worry about
them.
In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame pointer
register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you mark it as a
fixed register.  See <CODE>FIXED_REGISTERS</CODE> for more information.

<A NAME="IDX1670"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1671"></A>
<DT><CODE>INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (<VAR>depth-var</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to store in the variable <VAR>depth-var</VAR> the difference
between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately after
the function prologue.  The value would be computed from information
such as the result of <CODE>get_frame_size ()</CODE> and the tables of
registers <CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE> and <CODE>call_used_regs</CODE>.

If <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE> is defined, this macro will be not be used and
need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
<CODE>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</CODE> is defined to always be true; in that
case, you may set <VAR>depth-var</VAR> to anything.

<A NAME="IDX1672"></A>
<DT><CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If it is not
defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler is to replace
references to the frame pointer with references to the stack pointer.

The definition of this macro is a list of structure initializations, each
of which specifies an original and replacement register.

On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not known until
the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a separate hard register
must be used for the argument pointer.  This register can be eliminated by
replacing it with either the frame pointer or the argument pointer,
depending on whether or not the frame pointer has been eliminated.

In this case, you might specify:

<PRE>
#define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
{{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
 {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}
</PRE>

Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack pointer is
specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

<A NAME="IDX1673"></A>
<DT><CODE>CAN_ELIMINATE (<VAR>from-reg</VAR>, <VAR>to-reg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to try
to replace register number <VAR>from-reg</VAR> with register number
<VAR>to-reg</VAR>.  This macro need only be defined if <CODE>ELIMINABLE_REGS</CODE>
is defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the cases
preventing register elimination are things that the compiler already
knows about.

<A NAME="IDX1674"></A>
<DT><CODE>INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (<VAR>from-reg</VAR>, <VAR>to-reg</VAR>, <VAR>offset-var</VAR>)</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX1678"></A>
 
Define this macro if an argument declared in a prototype as an

mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.

<A NAME="IDX1679"></A>
<DT><CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING (<VAR>npushed</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
stack when an instruction attempts to push <VAR>npushed</VAR> bytes.

If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not define
this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate strategy: to
allocate the entire argument block and then store the arguments into
it.

On some machines, the definition


<PRE>
#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)
</PRE>

will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear
to push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
alignment.  Then the definition should be


<PRE>
#define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) &#38; ~1)

If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments
will be computed and placed into the variable
<CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE>.  No space will be pushed
onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
increase the stack frame size by this amount.

Defining both <CODE>PUSH_ROUNDING</CODE> and <CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE>
is not proper.

<A NAME="IDX1682"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<VAR>fndecl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has been
allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
registers.

The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area reserved for
arguments passed in registers for the function represented by <VAR>fndecl</VAR>,
which can be zero if GNU CC is calling a library function.

This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
machine-dependent stack frame: <CODE>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> says
which.

<A NAME="IDX1683"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1684"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (<VAR>const_size</VAR>, <VAR>var_size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are passed
in registers.  These should be used when the stack space allocated
for arguments in registers is not a simple constant independent of the
function declaration.

The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area that
we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments passed in registers.

The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the area
that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.  This takes two
arguments: an integer representing the number of bytes of fixed sized
arguments on the stack, and a tree representing the number of bytes of
variable sized arguments on the stack.

When these macros are defined, <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> will only be
called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a function
being called when it is known that such stack space must be allocated.
In each case this value can be easily computed.

When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space, and how
much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros instead of
<CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1685"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate the area
reserved for arguments passed in registers.

If <CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE> is defined, this macro controls
whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
<CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1686"></A>
<DT><CODE>STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is defined, but the
stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is placed on the
stack beyond the <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> area.  Defining this macro
suppresses this behavior and causes the parameter to be passed on the
stack in its natural location.

<A NAME="IDX1687"></A>
<DT><CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS (<VAR>fundecl</VAR>, <VAR>funtype</VAR>, <VAR>stack-size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the
function pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all
after the function returns.

<VAR>fundecl</VAR> is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE> that describes the declaration of the function.
From this you can obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of the function.

<VAR>funtype</VAR> is a C variable whose value is a tree node that
describes the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
<CODE>FUNCTION_TYPE</CODE> that describes the data type of the function.
From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
arguments (if known).

When a call to a library function is being considered, <VAR>fundecl</VAR>
will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can do so
by their names.  Note that "library function" in this context means
a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known specially
in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being compiled.

<VAR>stack-size</VAR> is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling function.

On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the definition
of this macro is <VAR>stack-size</VAR>.  On the 68000, using the standard
calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so the value of
the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an alternative calling
convention is available in which functions that take a fixed number of
arguments pop them but other functions (such as <CODE>printf</CODE>) pop
nothing (the caller pops all).  When this convention is in use,
<VAR>funtype</VAR> is examined to determine whether a function takes a fixed
number of arguments.

This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1690"></A>
 
A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
in a register, and which register.

The arguments are <VAR>cum</VAR>, which summarizes all the previous
arguments; <VAR>mode</VAR>, the machine mode of the argument; <VAR>type</VAR>,
the data type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
(which happens for C support library functions); and <VAR>named</VAR>,
which is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
correspond to <SAMP>`...'</SAMP> in the called function's prototype.

The value of the expression is usually either a <CODE>reg</CODE> RTX for the
hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
argument on the stack.

For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments are
pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

The value of the expression can also be a <CODE>parallel</CODE> RTX.  This is
used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode of the
of the <CODE>parallel</CODE> should be the mode of the entire argument.  The
<CODE>parallel</CODE> holds any number of <CODE>expr_list</CODE> pairs; each one
describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
<CODE>expr_list</CODE> the first operand must be a <CODE>reg</CODE> RTX for the hard
register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode of the
register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument is.  The
second operand of the <CODE>expr_list</CODE> is a <CODE>const_int</CODE> which gives
the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this part starts.
As a special exception the first <CODE>expr_list</CODE> in the <CODE>parallel</CODE> 
RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates that the bytes
starting from the second operand of that <CODE>expr_list</CODE> are stored on
the stack and not held in a register.

<A NAME="IDX1691"></A>
The usual way to make the ANSI library <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> work on a machine
where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
by making <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> return 0 whenever <VAR>named</VAR> is 0.

<A NAME="IDX1692"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1693"></A>
You may use the macro <CODE>MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
in the definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
type that must be passed in the stack.  If <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE>
is not defined and <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> returns non-zero for such an
argument, the compiler will abort.  If <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is
defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then loaded into
a register.

<A NAME="IDX1694"></A>
<DT><CODE>MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define as a C expression that evaluates to nonzero if we do not know how
to pass TYPE solely in registers.  The file <TT>`expr.h'</TT> defines a
definition that is usually appropriate, refer to <TT>`expr.h'</TT> for additional
documentation.

<A NAME="IDX1695"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
argument.

For such machines, <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> computes the register in which
the caller passes the value, and <CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE> should
be defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
where the arguments will arrive.

If <CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE> is not defined, <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE>
serves both purposes.
<A NAME="IDX1696"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are entirely
pushed on the stack.

On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically the
first <VAR>n</VAR> words of arguments are passed in registers, and the rest
on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a <CODE>double</CODE> or a
structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be passed
in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells the
compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go in
registers.

<CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> for these arguments should return the first
register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
<CODE>FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG</CODE>, for the called function.

<A NAME="IDX1697"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by reference.
If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is made in memory and a
pointer to the argument is passed instead of the argument itself.
The pointer is passed in whatever way is appropriate for passing a pointer
to that type.

On machines where <CODE>REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE</CODE> is not defined, a suitable
definition of this macro might be

<PRE>
#define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
(CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
  MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1698"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called function's
responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by invisible reference.
Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes the address of the copy to the
routine being called.  When FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES is defined and is
nonzero, the caller does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the
"live" value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can be
determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a copy;
otherwise a copy must be made.

<A NAME="IDX1699"></A>
<DT><CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>
<DD>
A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first argument of
<CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> and other related values.  For some target machines,
the type <CODE>int</CODE> suffices and can hold the number of bytes of
argument so far.

There is no need to record in <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> anything about the
arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has other
variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on which all
arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to store anything in
<CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>; however, the data structure must exist and
should not be empty, so use <CODE>int</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1700"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>fntype</VAR>, <VAR>libname</VAR>, <VAR>indirect</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable <VAR>cum</VAR>
for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable has
type <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>.  The value of <VAR>fntype</VAR> is the tree node
for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
if the args are to a compiler support library function.  The value of
<VAR>indirect</VAR> is nonzero when processing an indirect call, for example
a call through a function pointer.  The value of <VAR>indirect</VAR> is zero
for a call to an explicitly named function, a library function call, or when
<CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> is used to find arguments for the function
being compiled.

When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
<VAR>libname</VAR> identifies which one.  It is a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> rtx which
contains the name of the function, as a string.  <VAR>libname</VAR> is 0 when
an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time this
macro is called, either <VAR>libname</VAR> or <VAR>fntype</VAR> is nonzero, but
never both of them at once.

<A NAME="IDX1701"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>fntype</VAR>, <VAR>libname</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> but overrides it for the purposes of
finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this macro is
undefined, <CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> is used instead.

The value passed for <VAR>libname</VAR> is always 0, since library routines
with special calling conventions are never compiled with GNU CC.  The
argument <VAR>libname</VAR> exists for symmetry with
<CODE>INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1702"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (<VAR>cum</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>named</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
<VAR>cum</VAR> to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The
values <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR> and <VAR>named</VAR> describe that argument.
Once this is done, the variable <VAR>cum</VAR> is suitable for analyzing
the <EM>following</EM> argument with <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE>, etc.
This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was passed
on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount of stack space
used for arguments without any special help.

<A NAME="IDX1703"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which direction,
to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value should be of type
<CODE>enum direction</CODE>: either <CODE>upward</CODE> to pad above the argument,
<CODE>downward</CODE> to pad below, or <CODE>none</CODE> to inhibit padding.

The <EM>amount</EM> of padding is always just enough to reach the next
multiple of <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY</CODE>; this macro does not control
it.

This macro has a default definition which is right for most systems.
For little-endian machines, the default is to pad upward.  For
big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward for an argument of
constant size shorter than an <CODE>int</CODE>, and upward otherwise.

<A NAME="IDX1704"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in bits,
of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is not defined,
<CODE>PARM_BOUNDARY</CODE> is used for all arguments.

<A NAME="IDX1705"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>regno</VAR> is the number of a hard
register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This does
<EM>not</EM> include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on the
stack.

<A NAME="IDX1706"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOAD_ARGS_REVERSED</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, the order in which arguments are loaded into their
respective argument registers is reversed so that the last 
argument is loaded first.  This macro only effects arguments
passed in registers.

This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1710"></A>
 
Define this macro if <SAMP>`-traditional'</SAMP> should not cause functions
declared to return <CODE>float</CODE> to convert the value to <CODE>double</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1711"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE (<VAR>valtype</VAR>, <VAR>func</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
function returns a value of data type <VAR>valtype</VAR>.  <VAR>valtype</VAR> is
a tree node representing a data type.  Write <CODE>TYPE_MODE
(<VAR>valtype</VAR>)</CODE> to get the machine mode used to represent that type.
On many machines, only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most
machines, scalar values are returned in the same place regardless of
mode).
The value of the expression is usually a <CODE>reg</CODE> RTX for the hard
register where the return value is stored.  The value can also be a
<CODE>parallel</CODE> RTX, if the return value is in multiple places.  See
<CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE> for an explanation of the <CODE>parallel</CODE> form.

If <CODE>PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN</CODE> is defined, you must apply the same
promotion rules specified in <CODE>PROMOTE_MODE</CODE> if <VAR>valtype</VAR> is a
scalar type.

If the precise function being called is known, <VAR>func</VAR> is a tree
node (<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>) for it; otherwise, <VAR>func</VAR> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.
<CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> is not used for return vales with aggregate data
types, because these are returned in another way.  See
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE> and related macros, below.

<A NAME="IDX1712"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (<VAR>valtype</VAR>, <VAR>func</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows"
so that the register in which a function returns its value is not
the same as the one in which the caller sees the value.

For such machines, <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> computes the register in which
the caller will see the value.  <CODE>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</CODE> should be
defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
value.
If <CODE>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</CODE> is not defined,
<CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE> serves both purposes.
<CODE>FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE</CODE> is not used for return vales with
aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.  See
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE> and related macros, below.

<A NAME="IDX1713"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBCALL_VALUE (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a library
function returns a value of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  If the precise function
being called is known, <VAR>func</VAR> is a tree node
(<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>) for it; otherwise, <VAR>func</VAR> is a null
pointer.  This makes it possible to use a different value-returning
convention for specific functions when all their calls are
known.
Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
compiled.

The definition of <CODE>LIBRARY_VALUE</CODE> need not be concerned aggregate
data types, because none of the library functions returns such types.

<A NAME="IDX1714"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>regno</VAR> is the number of a hard
register in which the values of called function may come back.

A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as the
second of a pair (for a value of type <CODE>double</CODE>, say) need not be
recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
suffices:


<PRE>
#define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)
</PRE>

If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the called
function use different registers for the return value, this macro
should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

<A NAME="IDX1715"></A>
<DT><CODE>APPLY_RESULT_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if <SAMP>`untyped_call'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`untyped_return'</SAMP>
need more space than is implied by <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P</CODE> for
saving and restoring an arbitrary return value.

<P>
When a function value's mode is <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> (and in some other
cases), the value is not returned according to <CODE>FUNCTION_VALUE</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC219">How Scalar Function Values Are Returned</A>).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a
block of memory in which the value should be stored.  This address
is called the <STRONG>structure value address</STRONG>.

</P>
<P>
This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>RETURN_IN_MEMORY (<VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1720"></A>
 
A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value says
to return the function value in memory, just as large structures are
always returned.  Here <VAR>type</VAR> will be a C expression of type
<CODE>tree</CODE>, representing the data type of the value.

Note that values of mode <CODE>BLKmode</CODE> must be explicitly handled
by this macro.  Also, the option <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP>
takes effect regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is
possible to leave the macro undefined; this causes a default
definition to be used, whose value is the constant 1 for <CODE>BLKmode</CODE>
values, and 0 otherwise.

Do not use this macro to indicate that structures and unions should always
be returned in memory.  You should instead use <CODE>DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN</CODE>
to indicate this.

<A NAME="IDX1721"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values must be
in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should be defined
only if needed for compatibility with other compilers or with an ABI.
If you define this macro to be 0, then the conventions used for structure
and union return values are decided by the <CODE>RETURN_IN_MEMORY</CODE> macro.

If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

<A NAME="IDX1722"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM</CODE> should be the number of that register.

<A NAME="IDX1723"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE</CODE> as an expression returning an RTX for the place
where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is passed as
an "invisible" first argument.

<A NAME="IDX1724"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
On some architectures the place where the structure value address
is found by the called function is not the same place that the
caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.

If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
register, define this macro as the register number.

<A NAME="IDX1725"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</CODE>
<DD>
If the incoming location is not a register, then you should define
<CODE>STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING</CODE> as an expression for an RTX for where the
called function should find the value.  If it should find the value on
the stack, define this to create a <CODE>mem</CODE> which refers to the frame
pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is passed as an
"invisible" first argument.

<A NAME="IDX1726"></A>
<DT><CODE>PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target machine
for returning structures and unions is for the called function to return
the address of a static variable containing the value.

Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the caller to
pass an address to the subroutine.

This macro has effect in <SAMP>`-fpcc-struct-return'</SAMP> mode, but it does
nothing when you use <SAMP>`-freg-struct-return'</SAMP> mode.

<H3><A NAME="SEC221" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC221">Caller-Saves Register Allocation</A></H3>

<P>
If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1727"></A>
 
Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not preserve
any registers; in other words, if <CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> has 1
for all registers.  When defined, this macro enables <SAMP>`-fcaller-saves'</SAMP> 
by default for all optimization levels.  It has no effect for optimization
levels 2 and higher, where <SAMP>`-fcaller-saves'</SAMP> is the default.

<A NAME="IDX1728"></A>
<DT><CODE>CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (<VAR>refs</VAR>, <VAR>calls</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider placing
a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and saving and
restoring it around each function call.  The expression should be 1 when
this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on most
machines: <CODE>4 * <VAR>calls</VAR> &#60; <VAR>refs</VAR></CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1729"></A>
<DT><CODE>HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (<VAR>regno</VAR>, <VAR>nregs</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving <VAR>nregs</VAR>
of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register <VAR>regno</VAR>.  If
<VAR>regno</VAR> is unsuitable for caller save, <CODE>VOIDmode</CODE> should be
returned.  For most machines this macro need not be defined since GCC
will select the smallest suitable mode.

<H3><A NAME="SEC222" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC222">Function Entry and Exit</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1730"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1731"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1732"></A>

</P>
<P>
This section describes the macros that output function entry
(<STRONG>prologue</STRONG>) and exit (<STRONG>epilogue</STRONG>) code.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1733"></A>
 
A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry to a
function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the stack frame,
initializing the frame pointer register, saving registers that must be
saved, and allocating <VAR>size</VAR> additional bytes of storage for the
local variables.  <VAR>size</VAR> is an integer.  <VAR>file</VAR> is a stdio
stream to which the assembler code should be output.

The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by this
macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

<A NAME="IDX1734"></A>
To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the array
<CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE>: element <VAR>r</VAR> is nonzero if hard register
<VAR>r</VAR> is used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
prologue should save register <VAR>r</VAR>, provided it is not one of the
call-used registers.  (<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must likewise use
<CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE>.)

On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code does
not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows, even if
they are supposed to be preserved by function calls; instead it takes
appropriate steps to "push" the register stack, if any non-call-used
registers are used in the function.

<A NAME="IDX1735"></A>
On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether a
frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<CODE>frame_pointer_needed</CODE>.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC216">Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer</A>.

The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack space
required for the function.  This stack space consists of the regions
listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated in the
order listed, with the last listed region closest to the top of the
stack (the lowest address if <CODE>STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD</CODE> is defined, and
the highest address if it is not defined).  You can use a different order
for a machine if doing so is more convenient or required for
compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where required by standard
or by a debugger, there is no reason why the stack layout used by GCC
need agree with that used by other compilers for a machine.


<UL>
<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1736"></A>
A region of <CODE>current_function_pretend_args_size</CODE> bytes of
uninitialized space just underneath the first argument arriving on the
stack.  (This may not be at the very start of the allocated stack region
if the calling sequence has pushed anything else since pushing the stack
arguments.  But usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed
yet, because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)  This
region is used on machines where an argument may be passed partly in
registers and partly in memory, and, in some cases to support the
features in <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> and <TT>`stdargs.h'</TT>.

<LI>

An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the function.
The size of this area, which may also include space for such things as
the return address and pointers to previous stack frames, is
machine-specific and usually depends on which registers have been used
in the function.  Machines with register windows often do not require
a save area.

<LI>

A region of at least <VAR>size</VAR> bytes, possibly rounded up to an allocation
boundary, to contain the local variables of the function.  On some machines,
this region and the save area may occur in the opposite order, with the
save area closer to the top of the stack.

<LI>

<A NAME="IDX1737"></A>
Optionally, when <CODE>ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS</CODE> is defined, a region of
<CODE>current_function_outgoing_args_size</CODE> bytes to be used for outgoing
argument lists of the function.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC217">Passing Function Arguments on the Stack</A>.
</UL>

Normally, it is necessary for the macros <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
variable <CODE>current_function_is_leaf</CODE> is nonzero for such a function.

<A NAME="IDX1738"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.

Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for which
frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a final
stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer, and the
compiler knows this regardless of <CODE>EXIT_IGNORE_STACK</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1739"></A>
<DT><CODE>EPILOGUE_USES (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers are
used by the epilogue or the <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> pattern.  The stack and frame
pointer registers are already be assumed to be used as needed.

<A NAME="IDX1740"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit from a
function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the saved
registers and stack pointer to their values when the function was
called, and returning control to the caller.  This macro takes the
same arguments as the macro <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE>, and the
registers to restore are determined from <CODE>regs_ever_live</CODE> and
<CODE>CALL_USED_REGISTERS</CODE> in the same way.

On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the work
of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
instruction the name <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> and do not define the macro
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> at all.

Do not define a pattern named <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> if you want the
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> to be used.  If you want the target switches
to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used, define a
<SAMP>`return'</SAMP> pattern with a validity condition that tests the target
switches appropriately.  If the <SAMP>`return'</SAMP> pattern's validity
condition is false, epilogues will be used.

On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for these
two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a frame pointer
is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
<CODE>frame_pointer_needed</CODE>.  The variable's value will be 1 when compiling
a function that needs a frame pointer.

Normally, <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must
treat leaf functions specially.  The C variable <CODE>current_function_is_leaf</CODE>
is nonzero for such a function.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC208">Handling Leaf Functions</A>.

On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020 when
given <SAMP>`-mrtd'</SAMP> pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
number of arguments.

<A NAME="IDX1741"></A>
Your definition of the macro <CODE>RETURN_POPS_ARGS</CODE> decides which
functions pop their own arguments.  <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> needs to
know what was decided.  The variable that is called
<CODE>current_function_pops_args</CODE> is the number of bytes of its
arguments that a function should pop.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC219">How Scalar Function Values Are Returned</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1742"></A>
<DT><CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to which
instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".  The
definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
representing the number of delay slots there.

<A NAME="IDX1743"></A>
<DT><CODE>ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns 1 if <VAR>insn</VAR> can be placed in delay
slot number <VAR>n</VAR> of the epilogue.

The argument <VAR>n</VAR> is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the number
of epilogue delay slots (what <CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE> returns).
If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot, in principle, it
may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.  Also, other insns may
(at least in principle) be considered for the so far unfilled delay
slot.

<A NAME="IDX1744"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1745"></A>
The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an RTL
list made with <CODE>insn_list</CODE> objects, stored in the variable
<CODE>current_function_epilogue_delay_list</CODE>.  The insn for the first
delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> should fill the delay slots by outputting the
insns in this list, usually by calling <CODE>final_scan_insn</CODE>.

You need not define this macro if you did not define
<CODE>DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1746"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>thunk_fndecl</VAR>, <VAR>delta</VAR>, <VAR>function</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for a thunk
function, used to implement C++ virtual function calls with multiple
inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a virtual function,
adjusting the implicit object parameter before handing control off to
the real function.

First, emit code to add the integer <VAR>delta</VAR> to the location that
contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the <CODE>this</CODE> pointer
in C++.  This is the incoming argument <EM>before</EM> the function prologue,
e.g. <SAMP>`%o0'</SAMP> on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the values of
all other incoming arguments.

After the addition, emit code to jump to <VAR>function</VAR>, which is a
<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
not touch the return address.  Hence returning from <VAR>FUNCTION</VAR> will
return to whoever called the current <SAMP>`thunk'</SAMP>.

The effect must be as if <VAR>function</VAR> had been called directly with
the adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for emitting all
of the code for a thunk function; <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> are not invoked.

The <VAR>thunk_fndecl</VAR> is redundant.  (<VAR>delta</VAR> and <VAR>function</VAR>
have already been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on
some targets, but probably not.

If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in the C++
frontend will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk that calls
<VAR>function</VAR> instead of jumping to it.  The generic approach does
not support varargs.

<P>
These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1748"></A>
 
A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR> some
assembler code to call the profiling subroutine <CODE>mcount</CODE>.
Before calling, the assembler code must load the address of a
counter variable into a register where <CODE>mcount</CODE> expects to
find the address.  The name of this variable is <SAMP>`LP'</SAMP> followed
by the number <VAR>labelno</VAR>, so you would generate the name using
<SAMP>`LP%d'</SAMP> in a <CODE>fprintf</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1749"></A>
The details of how the address should be passed to <CODE>mcount</CODE> are
determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
results.

<A NAME="IDX1750"></A>
<DT><CODE>PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come before
the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes after.

<A NAME="IDX1751"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1752"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR> some
assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
object module.  The global compile flag <CODE>profile_block_flag</CODE>
distinguishes two profile modes.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>profile_block_flag != 2</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1753"></A>
 
Output code to call the subroutine <CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE> once per
object module, passing it as its sole argument the address of a block
allocated in the object module.

The name of the block is a local symbol made with this statement:


<PRE>
ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>buffer</VAR>, "LPBX", 0);
</PRE>

Of course, since you are writing the definition of
<CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> as well as that of this macro, you
can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the name
that you know will result.

The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero if the
object module has already been initialized.  So test this word first,
and do not call <CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE> if the flag is
nonzero.  BLOCK_OR_LABEL contains a unique number which may be used to
generate a label as a branch destination when <CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE>
will not be called.

Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:


<PRE>
  cmp (LPBX0),0
  bne local_label
  parameter1 &#60;- LPBX0
  call __bb_init_func
local_label:
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1754"></A>
<DT><CODE>profile_block_flag == 2</CODE>
<DD>
Output code to call the subroutine <CODE>__bb_init_trace_func</CODE>
and pass two parameters to it.  The first parameter is the same as
for <CODE>__bb_init_func</CODE>.  The second parameter is the number of the
first basic block of the function as given by BLOCK_OR_LABEL.  Note
that <CODE>__bb_init_trace_func</CODE> has to be called, even if the object
module has been initialized already.

Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:

<PRE>
parameter1 &#60;- LPBX0
parameter2 &#60;- BLOCK_OR_LABEL
call __bb_init_trace_func
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1755"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1756"></A>
<DT><CODE>BLOCK_PROFILER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>blockno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR> some
assembler code to increment the count associated with the basic
block number <VAR>blockno</VAR>.  The global compile flag
<CODE>profile_block_flag</CODE> distinguishes two profile modes.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>profile_block_flag != 2</CODE>
<DD>
Output code to increment the counter directly.  Basic blocks are
numbered separately from zero within each compilation.  The count
associated with block number <VAR>blockno</VAR> is at index
<VAR>blockno</VAR> in a vector of words; the name of this array is a local
symbol made with this statement:


<PRE>
ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>buffer</VAR>, "LPBX", 2);
</PRE>

Of course, since you are writing the definition of
<CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> as well as that of this macro, you
can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and use the name
that you know will result.

Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:


<PRE>
inc (LPBX2+4*BLOCKNO)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1757"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1758"></A>
<DT><CODE>profile_block_flag == 2</CODE>
<DD>
Output code to initialize the global structure <CODE>__bb</CODE> and
call the function <CODE>__bb_trace_func</CODE>, which will increment the
counter.

<CODE>__bb</CODE> consists of two words.  In the first word, the current
basic block number, as given by BLOCKNO, has to be stored.  In
the second word, the address of a block allocated in the object
module has to be stored.  The address is given by the label created
with this statement:


<PRE>
ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>buffer</VAR>, "LPBX", 0);
</PRE>

Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks like:

<PRE>
move BLOCKNO -&#62; (__bb)
move LPBX0 -&#62; (__bb+4)
call __bb_trace_func
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1760"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1761"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT (<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or compound statement to output to <VAR>file</VAR>
assembler code to call function <CODE>__bb_trace_ret</CODE>.  The
assembler code should only be output
if the global compile flag <CODE>profile_block_flag</CODE> == 2.  This
macro has to be used at every place where code for returning from
a function is generated (e.g. <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE>).  Although
you have to write the definition of <CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE>
as well, you have to define this macro to tell the compiler, that
the proper call to <CODE>__bb_trace_ret</CODE> is produced.

<DT><CODE>MACHINE_STATE_SAVE (<VAR>id</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or compound statement to save all registers, which may
be clobbered by a function call, including condition codes.  The
<CODE>asm</CODE> statement will be mostly likely needed to handle this
task.  Local labels in the assembler code can be concatenated with the
string <VAR>id</VAR>, to obtain a unique lable name.

Registers or condition codes clobbered by <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> or
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must be saved in the macros
<CODE>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER</CODE>, <CODE>FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT</CODE> and

Registers or condition codes clobbered by <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> or
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE> must be restored in the macros

<H2><A NAME="SEC224" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC224">Implementing the Varargs Macros</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1771"></A>

</P>
<P>
GNU CC comes with an implementation of <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> and
<TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> that work without change on machines that pass arguments
on the stack.  Other machines require their own implementations of
varargs, and the two machine independent header files must have
conditionals to include it.

</P>
<P>
ANSI <TT>`stdarg.h'</TT> differs from traditional <TT>`varargs.h'</TT> mainly in
the calling convention for <CODE>va_start</CODE>.  The traditional
implementation takes just one argument, which is the variable in which
to store the argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of
<CODE>va_start</CODE> takes an additional second argument.  The user is
supposed to write the last named argument of the function here.

</P>
<P>
However, <CODE>va_start</CODE> should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>__builtin_saveregs ()</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1772"></A>
 
Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in memory so
that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI and traditional
versions of <CODE>va_start</CODE> must use <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>, unless
you use <CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> (see below) instead.

On some machines, <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> is open-coded under the
control of the macro <CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</CODE>.  On other machines,
it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
<TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>.

Code generated for the call to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> appears at the
beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
<CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> is written, regardless of what the code is.
This is because the registers must be saved before the function starts
to use them for its own purposes.

<A NAME="IDX1773"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_args_info (<VAR>category</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
registers.

In general, a machine may have several categories of registers used for
arguments, each for a particular category of data types.  (For example,
on some machines, floating-point registers are used for floating-point
arguments while other arguments are passed in the general registers.)
To make non-varargs functions use the proper calling convention, you
have defined the <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> data type to record how many
registers in each category have been used so far

<CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE> accesses the same data structure of type
<CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> after the ordinary argument layout is finished
with it, with <VAR>category</VAR> specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
value indicates the first unused register in a given category.

Normally, you would use <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE> in the implementation
of <CODE>va_start</CODE>, accessing each category just once and storing the
value in the <CODE>va_list</CODE> object.  This is because <CODE>va_list</CODE> will
have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the
values accessed by <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1774"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_next_arg (<VAR>lastarg</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
This is the equivalent of <CODE>__builtin_args_info</CODE>, for stack
arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
argument, as type <CODE>void *</CODE>. If <CODE>ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD</CODE>, it
returns the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
argument.  Use it in <CODE>va_start</CODE> to initialize the pointer for
fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in <CODE>va_start</CODE> to
verify that the second parameter <VAR>lastarg</VAR> is the last named argument
of the current function.

<A NAME="IDX1775"></A>
<DT><CODE>__builtin_classify_type (<VAR>object</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
passed in which kind of register, your implementation of <CODE>va_arg</CODE>
has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
specified data type is to use <CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE> together
with <CODE>sizeof</CODE> and <CODE>__alignof__</CODE>.

<CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE> ignores the value of <VAR>object</VAR>,
considering only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what
kind of type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

The file <TT>`typeclass.h'</TT> defines an enumeration that you can use to
interpret the values of <CODE>__builtin_classify_type</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
These machine description macros help implement varargs:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (<VAR>args</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1776"></A>
 
If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
for a call to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.  This code will be moved to the
very beginning of the function, before any parameter access are made.
The return value of this function should be an RTX that contains the
value to use as the return of <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.

The argument <VAR>args</VAR> is a <CODE>tree_list</CODE> containing the arguments
that were passed to <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE>.

If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
call to the library function <SAMP>`__builtin_saveregs'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX1777"></A>
<DT><CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (<VAR>args_so_far</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>pretend_args_size</VAR>, <VAR>second_time</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
This macro offers an alternative to using <CODE>__builtin_saveregs</CODE> and
defining the macro <CODE>EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS</CODE>.  Use it to store the
anonymous register arguments into the stack so that all the arguments
appear to have been passed consecutively on the stack.  Once this is
done, you can use the standard implementation of varargs that works for
machines that pass all their arguments on the stack.

The argument <VAR>args_so_far</VAR> is the <CODE>CUMULATIVE_ARGS</CODE> data
structure, containing the values that obtain after processing of the
named arguments.  The arguments <VAR>mode</VAR> and <VAR>type</VAR> describe the
last named argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
stack all the argument registers <EM>not</EM> used for the named
arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into the
<CODE>int</CODE>-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
<VAR>pretend_args_size</VAR>.  The value that you store here will serve as
additional offset for setting up the stack frame.

Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
compile time without knowing their data types,
<CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> is only useful on machines that have just
a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for all data
types.

If the argument <VAR>second_time</VAR> is nonzero, it means that the
arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.  This
happens for an inline function, which is not actually compiled until the
end of the source file.  The macro <CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> should
not generate any instructions in this case.

<A NAME="IDX1778"></A>
<DT><CODE>STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the location where a function
argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a named argument.

This macro controls how the <VAR>named</VAR> argument to <CODE>FUNCTION_ARG</CODE>
is set for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this macro returns a
nonzero value, the <VAR>named</VAR> argument is always true for named
arguments, and false for unnamed arguments.  If it returns a value of
zero, but <CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> is defined, then all arguments
are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments except the last
are treated as named.

You need not define this macro if it always returns zero.

<A NAME="IDX1779"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED</CODE>
<DD>
If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
<CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE>, but the other works like neither
<CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> nor <CODE>STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING</CODE> was
defined, then define this macro to return nonzero if
<CODE>SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS</CODE> is used, zero otherwise.
Otherwise, you should not define this macro.

<H2><A NAME="SEC225" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC225">Trampolines for Nested Functions</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1780"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1781"></A>

</P>
<P>
A <STRONG>trampoline</STRONG> is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.

</P>
<P>
The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a constant
address into the static chain register, and jump to the real address of
the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k, this requires
two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the two addresses
exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.  On RISC
machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a register in
two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate immediate
operands.

</P>
<P>
The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the variable
parts--the static chain value and the function address--into the
immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1782"></A>
 
A C statement to output, on the stream <VAR>file</VAR>, assembler code for a
block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.  This
code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
automatically.

If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the block move
code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger than the code
to generate it on the spot.

<A NAME="IDX1783"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_SECTION</CODE>
<DD>
The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
trampoline template is to be placed (see section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC230">Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)</A>).  The default is
a value of <SAMP>`readonly_data_section'</SAMP>, which places the trampoline in
the section containing read-only data.

<A NAME="IDX1784"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an integer.

<A NAME="IDX1785"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

If you don't define this macro, the value of <CODE>BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT</CODE>
is used for aligning trampolines.

<A NAME="IDX1786"></A>
<DT><CODE>INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (<VAR>addr</VAR>, <VAR>fnaddr</VAR>, <VAR>static_chain</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
<VAR>addr</VAR> is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; <VAR>fnaddr</VAR> is
an RTX for the address of the nested function; <VAR>static_chain</VAR> is an
RTX for the static chain value that should be passed to the function
when it is called.

<A NAME="IDX1787"></A>
<DT><CODE>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (<VAR>fp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The
expression value should be an RTX representing a memory reference to the
space for the trampoline.

<A NAME="IDX1788"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1789"></A>
If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is allocated as
a stack slot.  This default is right for most machines.  The exceptions
are machines where it is impossible to execute instructions in the stack
area.  On such machines, you may have to implement a separate stack,
using this macro in conjunction with <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> and
<CODE>FUNCTION_EPILOGUE</CODE>.

<VAR>fp</VAR> points to a data structure, a <CODE>struct function</CODE>, which
describes the compilation status of the immediate containing function of
the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally (when
<CODE>ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE</CODE> is not defined), the stack slot for the
trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.  Other
allocation strategies probably must do something analogous with this
information.
</DL>

<P>
Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they have
separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack location
fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when the program
jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

</P>
<P>
Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts of
the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is to
make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

</P>
<P>
To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized, define
the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_SIZE</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1790"></A>
 
The total size in bytes of the cache.

<A NAME="IDX1791"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH</CODE>
<DD>
The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into cache
lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous chunk of data
fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into the cache, an
entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a cache line is
always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.

<A NAME="IDX1792"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_CACHE_DEPTH</CODE>
<DD>
The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular memory
location.
</DL>

<P>
Alternatively, if the machine has system calls or instructions to clear
the instruction cache directly, you can define the following macro.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (<VAR>BEG</VAR>, <VAR>END</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1793"></A>
 
If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the <EM>instruction
cache</EM> in the specified interval.  If it is not defined, and the macro
INSN_CACHE_SIZE is defined, some generic code is generated to clear the
cache.  The definition of this macro would typically be a series of
<CODE>asm</CODE> statements.  Both <VAR>BEG</VAR> and <VAR>END</VAR> are both pointer
expressions.
</DL>

<P>
To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In addition,
you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill an entire
cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that the
beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same point in
its cache line.  Look in <TT>`m68k.h'</TT> as a guide.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1794"></A>
 
Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do their
work.  The macro should expand to a series of <CODE>asm</CODE> statements
which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a library function named
<CODE>__transfer_from_trampoline</CODE>.

If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a compiled
C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so by placing a
special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use one <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement to generate an assembler label, and another to make the label
global.  Then trampolines can use that label to jump directly to your
special assembler code.

<A NAME="IDX1807"></A>
<DT><CODE>INIT_TARGET_OPTABS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C statement that declares additional library

initializing all the normal library routines.

<A NAME="IDX1808"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1809"></A>
<DT><CODE>TARGET_EDOM</CODE>
<DD>
The value of <CODE>EDOM</CODE> on the target machine, as a C integer constant
expression.  If you don't define this macro, GNU CC does not attempt to
deposit the value of <CODE>EDOM</CODE> into <CODE>errno</CODE> directly.  Look in
<TT>`/usr/include/errno.h'</TT> to find the value of <CODE>EDOM</CODE> on your
system.

If you do not define <CODE>TARGET_EDOM</CODE>, then compiled code reports
domain errors by calling the library function and letting it report the
error.  If mathematical functions on your system use <CODE>matherr</CODE> when
there is an error, then you should leave <CODE>TARGET_EDOM</CODE> undefined so
that <CODE>matherr</CODE> is used normally.

<A NAME="IDX1810"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1811"></A>
<DT><CODE>GEN_ERRNO_RTX</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression that
refers to the global "variable" <CODE>errno</CODE>.  (On certain systems,
<CODE>errno</CODE> may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
macro, a reasonable default is used.

<A NAME="IDX1814"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1815"></A>

<DT><CODE>TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if GNU CC should generate calls to the System V

rather than the BSD functions <CODE>bcopy</CODE> and <CODE>bzero</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1817"></A>
<DT><CODE>LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if only <CODE>float</CODE> arguments cannot be passed to
library routines (so they must be converted to <CODE>double</CODE>).  This
macro affects both how library calls are generated and how the library
routines in <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT> accept their arguments.  It is useful on
machines where floating and fixed point arguments are passed
differently, such as the i860.

<A NAME="IDX1818"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_ARG_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to override the type used by the library routines to
pick up arguments of type <CODE>float</CODE>.  (By default, they use a union
of <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>int</CODE>.)

The obvious choice would be <CODE>float</CODE>---but that won't work with
traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as <CODE>float</CODE>
to arrive as <CODE>double</CODE>.  To avoid this conversion, the library routines
ask for the value as some other type and then treat it as a <CODE>float</CODE>.

On some systems, no other type will work for this.  For these systems,
you must use <CODE>LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE</CODE> instead, to force conversion of
the values <CODE>double</CODE> before they are passed.

<A NAME="IDX1819"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOATIFY (<VAR>passed-value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to override the way library routines redesignate a
<CODE>float</CODE> argument as a <CODE>float</CODE> instead of the type it was
passed as.  The default is an expression which takes the <CODE>float</CODE>
field of the union.

<A NAME="IDX1820"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to override the type used by the library routines to
return values that ought to have type <CODE>float</CODE>.  (By default, they
use <CODE>int</CODE>.)

The obvious choice would be <CODE>float</CODE>---but that won't work with
traditional C compilers gratuitously convert values declared as
<CODE>float</CODE> into <CODE>double</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1821"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTIFY (<VAR>float-value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to override the way the value of a
<CODE>float</CODE>-returning library routine should be packaged in order to
return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type
<CODE>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> (normally <CODE>int</CODE>).

These values can't be returned as type <CODE>float</CODE> because traditional
C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a <CODE>double</CODE>.

A local variable named <CODE>intify</CODE> is always available when the macro
<CODE>INTIFY</CODE> is used.  It is a union of a <CODE>float</CODE> field named
<CODE>f</CODE> and a field named <CODE>i</CODE> whose type is
<CODE>FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>.

If you don't define this macro, the default definition works by copying
the value through that union.

<A NAME="IDX1822"></A>
<DT><CODE>nongcc_SI_type</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to
<CODE>SImode</CODE> in the system's own C compiler.

You need not define this macro if that type is <CODE>long int</CODE>, as it usually
is.

<A NAME="IDX1823"></A>
<DT><CODE>nongcc_word_type</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to the
word_mode in the system's own C compiler.

You need not define this macro if that type is <CODE>long int</CODE>, as it usually
is.

<A NAME="IDX1824"></A>
<DT><CODE>perform_...</CODE>
<DD>
Define these macros to supply explicit C statements to carry out various
arithmetic operations on types <CODE>float</CODE> and <CODE>double</CODE> in the
library routines in <TT>`libgcc1.c'</TT>.  See that file for a full list
of these macros and their arguments.

On most machines, you don't need to define any of these macros, because
the C compiler that comes with the system takes care of doing them.

<A NAME="IDX1825"></A>
<DT><CODE>NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to generate code for Objective C message sending using
the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling convention
involves passing the object, the selector and the method arguments all
at once to the method-lookup library function.

The default calling convention passes just the object and the selector
to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the method.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>HAVE_POST_INCREMENT</CODE>

A C expression that is nonzero the machine supports post-increment addressing.

<A NAME="IDX1830"></A>
<DT><CODE>HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT</CODE>

<DT><CODE>HAVE_POST_DECREMENT</CODE>

<DT><CODE>HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT</CODE>
<DD>
Similar for other kinds of addressing.

<A NAME="IDX1831"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is 1 if the RTX <VAR>x</VAR> is a constant which
is a valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
<CODE>CONSTANT_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>, but a few machines are more restrictive
in which constant addresses are supported.

<A NAME="IDX1832"></A>
<CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE> accepts integer-values expressions whose values are
not explicitly known, such as <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>, <CODE>label_ref</CODE>, and
<CODE>high</CODE> expressions and <CODE>const</CODE> arithmetic expressions, in
addition to <CODE>const_int</CODE> and <CODE>const_double</CODE> expressions.

<A NAME="IDX1833"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS</CODE>
<DD>
A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a valid
memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a value equal to
the maximum number that <CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE> would ever
accept.

<A NAME="IDX1834"></A>
<DT><CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>label</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement with a conditional <CODE>goto <VAR>label</VAR>;</CODE>
executed if <VAR>x</VAR> (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the
target machine for a memory operand of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.

It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
understand.

This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
with no hard register must be rejected.

The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be defined to
accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some kind of
register is required.

<A NAME="IDX1835"></A>
Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
macro define the macro <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE>.  You should use an
<CODE>#ifdef REG_OK_STRICT</CODE> conditional to define the strict variant
in that case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes (one
for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are typically
among the subroutines used to define <CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE>.
Then only these subroutine macros need have two variants; the higher
levels of macros may be the same whether strict or not.
Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>
and an integer are stored inside a <CODE>const</CODE> RTX to mark them as
constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
recognize any <CODE>const</CODE> as legitimate.

Usually <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE> is not prepared to handle constant
sums that are not marked with  <CODE>const</CODE>.  It assumes that a naked
<CODE>plus</CODE> indicates indexing.  If so, then you <EM>must</EM> reject such
naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of them will
be given to <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1836"></A>
On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends on
the section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the
macro <CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> to store the information into the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>, and then check for it here.  When you see a
<CODE>const</CODE>, you will have to look inside it to find the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> in order to determine the section.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC232">Defining the Output Assembler Language</A>.

<A NAME="IDX1837"></A>
The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.  Allocate
the new name in <CODE>saveable_obstack</CODE>.  You will have to modify
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> to remove and decode the added text and
output the name accordingly, and define <CODE>STRIP_NAME_ENCODING</CODE> to
access the original name string.

You can check the information stored here into the <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> in
the definitions of the macros <CODE>GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS</CODE> and
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1838"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> (assumed to be a <CODE>reg</CODE>
RTX) is valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it
should always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers must be
controlled by <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE> as described above.  This usually
requires two variant definitions, of which <CODE>REG_OK_STRICT</CODE>
controls the one actually used.

<A NAME="IDX1839"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is just like <CODE>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P</CODE>, except that
that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
<VAR>mode</VAR>.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
reference affects whether a register may be used as a base register.  If
you define this macro, the compiler will use it instead of
<CODE>REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1840"></A>
<DT><CODE>REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> (assumed to be a <CODE>reg</CODE>
RTX) is valid for use as an index register.

The difference between an index register and a base register is that
the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the sum of
two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one may be
labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which registers
may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both labelings,
looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or both registers
only if neither labeling works.

<A NAME="IDX1841"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>oldx</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>win</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement that attempts to replace <VAR>x</VAR> with a valid
memory address for an operand of mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  <VAR>win</VAR> will be a
C statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use


<PRE>
GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>win</VAR>);
</PRE>

to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

<A NAME="IDX1842"></A>
<VAR>x</VAR> will always be the result of a call to <CODE>break_out_memory_refs</CODE>,
and <VAR>oldx</VAR> will be the operand that was given to that function to produce
<VAR>x</VAR>.

The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure of
<VAR>x</VAR>.  If it transforms <VAR>x</VAR> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <VAR>x</VAR> (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.  In
fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

<A NAME="IDX1843"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>opnum</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>ind_levels</VAR>, <VAR>win</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement that attempts to replace <VAR>x</VAR>, which is an address
that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an operand of mode
<VAR>mode</VAR>.  <VAR>win</VAR> will be a C statement label elsewhere in the code.
It is not necessary to define this macro, but it might be useful for
performance reasons. 

For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate address
needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.  By defining
LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS appropriately, the intermediate addresses
generated for adjacent some stack slots can be made identical, and thus
be shared.

<EM>Note</EM>: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use this,
and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too much knowledge
of reload internals.

<EM>Note</EM>: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such addresses
then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

<A NAME="IDX1844"></A>
The macro definition should use <CODE>push_reload</CODE> to indicate parts that
need reloading; <VAR>opnum</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR> and <VAR>ind_levels</VAR> are usually
suitable to be passed unaltered to <CODE>push_reload</CODE>.

The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
<VAR>x</VAR>.  If it transforms <VAR>x</VAR> into a more legitimate form, it
should assign <VAR>x</VAR> (which will always be a C variable) a new value.
This also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
<CODE>push_reload</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1845"></A>
The macro definition may use <CODE>strict_memory_address_p</CODE> to test if
the address has become legitimate.

<A NAME="IDX1846"></A>
If you want to change only a part of <VAR>x</VAR>, one standard way of doing
this is to use <CODE>copy_rtx</CODE>.  Note, however, that is unshares only a
single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
top level, you'll need to replace first the top leve
It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
address;  but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

<A NAME="IDX1847"></A>
<DT><CODE>GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (<VAR>addr</VAR>, <VAR>label</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or compound statement with a conditional <CODE>goto
<VAR>label</VAR>;</CODE> executed if memory address <VAR>x</VAR> (an RTX) can have
different meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory
reference it is used for or if the address is valid for some modes
but not others.

Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have mode-dependent
effects because the amount of the increment or decrement is the size
of the operand being addressed.  Some machines have other mode-dependent
addresses.  Many RISC machines have no mode-dependent addresses.

You may assume that <VAR>addr</VAR> is a valid address for the machine.

<A NAME="IDX1848"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> is a legitimate constant for
an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that
<VAR>x</VAR> satisfies <CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE>, so you need not check this.  In fact,
<SAMP>`1'</SAMP> is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where
anything <CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE> is valid.</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC228" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC228">Condition Code Status</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1849"></A>

</P>
<P>
This describes the condition code status.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1850"></A>
The file <TT>`conditions.h'</TT> defines a variable <CODE>cc_status</CODE> to
describe how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of
the condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the machine
description header file.  It can also add additional machine-specific
information by defining <CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP</CODE>.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1851"></A>
 
C code for a data type which is used for declaring the <CODE>mdep</CODE>
component of <CODE>cc_status</CODE>.  It defaults to <CODE>int</CODE>.

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1852"></A>
<DT><CODE>CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to initialize the <CODE>mdep</CODE> field to "empty".
The default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use
the field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
define this macro to initialize it.

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1853"></A>
<DT><CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement to set the components of <CODE>cc_status</CODE>
appropriately for an insn <VAR>insn</VAR> whose body is <VAR>exp</VAR>.  It is
this macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that explicitly
set <CODE>(cc0)</CODE>.

This macro is not used on machines that do not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>.

If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
<CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> can leave <CODE>cc_status</CODE> unaltered for such
insns.  But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code
based on location <SAMP>`a4@(102)'</SAMP> and the current insn stores a new
value in <SAMP>`a4'</SAMP>.  Although the condition code is not changed by
this, it will no longer be true that it reflects the contents of
<SAMP>`a4@(102)'</SAMP>.  Therefore, <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> must alter
<CODE>cc_status</CODE> in this case to say that nothing is known about the
condition code value.

The definition of <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> must be prepared to deal
with the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
<CODE>parallel</CODE> RTXs containing various <CODE>reg</CODE>, <CODE>mem</CODE> or
constants which are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these
insns is not sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
<CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> should do when it sees one is just to run
<CODE>CC_STATUS_INIT</CODE>.

A possible definition of <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE> is to call a function
that looks at an attribute (see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC190">Instruction Attributes</A>) named, for example,
<SAMP>`cc'</SAMP>.  This avoids having detailed information about patterns in
two places, the <TT>`md'</TT> file and in <CODE>NOTICE_UPDATE_CC</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1854"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CC_MODES</CODE>
<DD>
A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
values in registers (see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC185">Defining Jump Instruction Patterns</A>).  These names are added
to <CODE>enum machine_mode</CODE> and all have class <CODE>MODE_CC</CODE>.  By
convention, they should start with <SAMP>`CC'</SAMP> and end with <SAMP>`mode'</SAMP>.

You should only define this macro if your machine does not use <CODE>cc0</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX1855"></A>
<DT><CODE>EXTRA_CC_NAMES</CODE>

A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in

<DT><CODE>CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (<VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>op0</VAR>, <VAR>op1</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
One some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but you can
convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For example, the Alpha
does not have a <CODE>GT</CODE> comparison, but you can use an <CODE>LT</CODE>
comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
required conversions.  <VAR>code</VAR> is the initial comparison code
and <VAR>op0</VAR> and <VAR>op1</VAR> are the left and right operands of the
comparison, respectively.  You should modify <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>op0</VAR>, and
<VAR>op1</VAR> as required.

GNU CC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this macro is
valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a pattern in the
<TT>`md'</TT> file.

You need not define this macro if it would never change the comparison
code or operands.

<A NAME="IDX1858"></A>
<DT><CODE>REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
comparison whose mode is <VAR>mode</VAR>.  If <CODE>SELECT_CC_MODE</CODE>
can ever return <VAR>mode</VAR> for a floating-point inequality comparison,
then <CODE>REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE> must be zero.

You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or if the
floating-point format is anything other than <CODE>IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT</CODE>.
For example, here is the definition used on the Sparc, where floating-point
inequality comparisons are always given <CODE>CCFPEmode</CODE>:

<DT><CODE>CONST_COSTS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>outer_code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1862"></A>
 
A part of a C <CODE>switch</CODE> statement that describes the relative costs
of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain <CODE>case</CODE> labels for
expression codes <CODE>const_int</CODE>, <CODE>const</CODE>, <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>,
<CODE>label_ref</CODE> and <CODE>const_double</CODE>.  Each case must ultimately
reach a <CODE>return</CODE> statement to return the relative cost of the use
of that kind of constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on
the precise value of the constant, which is available for examination in
<VAR>x</VAR>, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
found in <VAR>outer_code</VAR>.

<VAR>code</VAR> is the expression code--redundant, since it can be
obtained with <CODE>GET_CODE (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1863"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1864"></A>
<DT><CODE>RTX_COSTS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>outer_code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>CONST_COSTS</CODE> but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
<CODE>COSTS_N_INSNS (<VAR>n</VAR>)</CODE> to specify a cost equal to <VAR>n</VAR> fast
instructions.  <VAR>outer_code</VAR> is the code of the expression in which
<VAR>x</VAR> is contained.

This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost assumptions
are adequate for the target machine.

<A NAME="IDX1865"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_RTX_COSTS (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>outer_code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
This macro, if defined, is called for any case not handled by the
<CODE>RTX_COSTS</CODE> or <CODE>CONST_COSTS</CODE> macros.  This eliminates the need
to put case labels into the macro, but the code, or any functions it
calls, must assume that the RTL in <VAR>x</VAR> could be of any type that has
not already been handled.  The arguments are the same as for
<CODE>RTX_COSTS</CODE>, and the macro should execute a return statement giving
the cost of any RTL expressions that it can handle.  The default cost
calculation is used for any RTL for which this macro does not return a
value.

This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost assumptions
are adequate for the target machine.  

<A NAME="IDX1866"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADDRESS_COST (<VAR>address</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
<VAR>address</VAR>.  If not defined, the cost is computed from
the <VAR>address</VAR> expression and the <CODE>CONST_COSTS</CODE> values.

For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation of the
true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC machines, all
instructions normally have the same length and execution time.  Hence
all addresses will have equal costs.

In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form with
the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the same, lowest,
cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a register
and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.  When this macro
is not defined, the address will be computed in a register and memory
references will be indirect through that register.  On machines where
the cost of the addressing mode containing the sum is no higher than
that of a simple indirect reference, this will produce an additional
instruction and possibly require an additional register.  Proper
specification of this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

<VAR>address</VAR> need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
assigned a different cost.

On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
cheap as an address computation involving only one register, defining
<CODE>ADDRESS_COST</CODE> to reflect this can cause two registers to be live
over a region of code where only one would have been if
<CODE>ADDRESS_COST</CODE> were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs should
probably only be given to addresses with different numbers of registers
on machines with lots of registers.

This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
constant.

<A NAME="IDX1867"></A>
<DT><CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST (<VAR>from</VAR>, <VAR>to</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
<VAR>from</VAR> to one in class <VAR>to</VAR>.  The classes are expressed using
the enumeration values such as <CODE>GENERAL_REGS</CODE>.  A value of 2 is the
default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when <VAR>from</VAR> is the
same as <VAR>to</VAR>; on some machines it is expensive to move between
registers if they are not general registers.

If reload sees an insn consisting of a single <CODE>set</CODE> between two
hard registers, and if <CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</CODE> applied to their
classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that the
constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than 2 will
allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You should do this
if the <SAMP>`mov<VAR>m</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern's constraints do not allow such copying.

<A NAME="IDX1868"></A>
<DT><CODE>MEMORY_MOVE_COST (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>class</VAR>, <VAR>in</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode <VAR>mode</VAR> between a
register of class <VAR>class</VAR> and memory; <VAR>in</VAR> is zero if the value
is to be written to memory, non-zero if it is to be read in.  This cost
is relative to those in <CODE>REGISTER_MOVE_COST</CODE>.  If moving between
registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers, you
should define this macro to express the relative cost.

If you do not define this macro, GNU CC uses a default cost of 4 plus
the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to copy
between memory and a register of <VAR>class</VAR> but the reload mechanism is
more complex than copying via an intermediate, define this macro to
reflect the actual cost of the move.

GNU CC defines the function <CODE>memory_move_secondary_cost</CODE> if
secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to copying via
a secondary register.  If your machine copies from memory using a
secondary register in the conventional way but the default base value of
4 is not correct for your machine, define this macro to add some other
value to the result of that function.  The arguments to that function
are the same as to this macro.

<A NAME="IDX1869"></A>
<DT><CODE>BRANCH_COST</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1 is
the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.
</DL>

<P>
Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative costs,
but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC would
ordinarily expect.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1870"></A>
 
Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing less
than a word of memory (i.e. a <CODE>char</CODE> or a <CODE>short</CODE>) is no
faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in cost
between byte and (aligned) word loads.

When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a fullword
load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes accesses are
faster than word accesses, using word accesses is preferable since it
may eliminate subsequent memory access if subsequent accesses occur to
other fields in the same word of the structure, but to different bytes.

<A NAME="IDX1871"></A>
<DT><CODE>SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if zero-extension (of a <CODE>char</CODE> or <CODE>short</CODE>
to an <CODE>int</CODE>) can be done faster if the destination is a register
that is known to be zero.

If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
recognize RTL structures like this:


<PRE>
(set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI ...) 0)) ...)
</PRE>

and likewise for <CODE>HImode</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1872"></A>
<DT><CODE>SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a cost
many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they are
emulated in a trap handler.

When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
<CODE>STRICT_ALIGNMENT</CODE> were non-zero when generating code for block
moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be produced.
Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned accesses only add a
cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.

<A NAME="IDX1873"></A>
<DT><CODE>DONT_REDUCE_ADDR</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory addresses.
(On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do harm rather
than good.)

<A NAME="IDX1874"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_RATIO</CODE>
<DD>
The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns, <EM>below</EM>
which a sequence of insns  should be generated instead of a
string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will always
make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in increased code size.

Note that on machines with no memory-to-memory move insns, this macro denotes
the corresponding number of memory-to-memory <EM>sequences</EM>.

If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

<A NAME="IDX1875"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (<VAR>size</VAR>, <VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression used to determine whether <CODE>move_by_pieces</CODE> will be used to
copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move mechanism
will be used.  Defaults to 1 if <CODE>move_by_pieces_ninsns</CODE> returns less
than <CODE>MOVE_RATIO</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1876"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_MAX_PIECES</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression used by <CODE>move_by_pieces</CODE> to determine the largest unit
a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to <CODE>MOVE_MAX</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1877"></A>
<DT><CODE>USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a good
thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of

<A NAME="IDX1878"></A>
<DT><CODE>USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a good

<A NAME="IDX1884"></A>
<DT><CODE>USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX1885"></A>

<A NAME="IDX1886"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call

<A NAME="IDX1887"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADJUST_COST (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>link</VAR>, <VAR>dep_insn</VAR>, <VAR>cost</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable <VAR>cost</VAR>
based on the relationship between <VAR>insn</VAR> that is dependent on
<VAR>dep_insn</VAR> through the dependence <VAR>link</VAR>.  The default is to
make no adjustment to <VAR>cost</VAR>.  This can be used for example to
specify to the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not
incur the same cost as a data-dependence.

<A NAME="IDX1888"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADJUST_PRIORITY (<VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer scheduling
priority <CODE>INSN_PRIORITY(<VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>.  Reduce the priority
to execute the <VAR>insn</VAR> earlier, increase the priority to execute
<VAR>insn</VAR> later.    Do not define this macro if you do not need to
adjust the scheduling priorities of insns.

On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables are
placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your machine,
this macro should be defined to be the name of a function (either
<CODE>data_section</CODE> or a function defined in <CODE>EXTRA_SECTIONS</CODE>) that
switches to the section to be used for read-only items.

If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro should

<A NAME="IDX1902"></A>
<DT><CODE>SELECT_SECTION (<VAR>exp</VAR>, <VAR>reloc</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section for
output of <VAR>exp</VAR>.  You can assume that <VAR>exp</VAR> is either a
<CODE>VAR_DECL</CODE> node or a constant of some sort.  <VAR>reloc</VAR>
indicates whether the initial value of <VAR>exp</VAR> requires link-time
relocations.  Select the section by calling <CODE>text_section</CODE> or one

<DD>
A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section for

is some kind of constant in RTL.  The argument <VAR>mode</VAR> is redundant
except in the case of a <CODE>const_int</CODE> rtx.  Select the section by

readonly data section is used.

This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data section.

<A NAME="IDX1905"></A>
<DT><CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated differently
depending on something about the variable or function named by the
symbol (such as what section it is in).

The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the rtl for
<VAR>decl</VAR> has been created and stored in <CODE>DECL_RTL (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>.
The value of the rtl will be a <CODE>mem</CODE> whose address is a
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1906"></A>
The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE> (such as <CODE>SYMBOL_REF_FLAG</CODE>) or to store a

<CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> alters the symbol's name string.

<A NAME="IDX1908"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNIQUE_SECTION_P (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which evaluates to true if <VAR>decl</VAR> should be placed
into a unique section for some target-specific reason.  If you do not
define this macro, the default is <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.  Note that the flag
<SAMP>`-ffunction-sections'</SAMP> will also cause functions to be placed into
unique sections.

<A NAME="IDX1909"></A>
<DT><CODE>UNIQUE_SECTION (<VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>reloc</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to build up a unique section name, expressed as a

This section describes macros that help implement generation of position

<DT><CODE>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1912"></A>
 
The register number of the register used to address a table of static
data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is defined by a
processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).  When this macro
is defined, RTL is generated for this register once, as with the stack
pointer and frame pointer registers.  If this macro is not defined, it
is up to the machine-dependent files to allocate such a register (if
necessary).

<A NAME="IDX1913"></A>
<DT><CODE>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the register defined by

this macro if <CODE>PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM</CODE> is not defined.

<A NAME="IDX1914"></A>
<DT><CODE>FINALIZE_PIC</CODE>
<DD>
By generating position-independent code, when two different programs (A
and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of the library can be
shared whether or not the library is linked at the same address for both
programs.  In some of these environments, position-independent code
requires not only the use of different addressing modes, but also
special code to enable the use of these addressing modes.

The <CODE>FINALIZE_PIC</CODE> macro serves as a hook to emit these special
codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but not
before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of compiling an
inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC prologues being
included in functions which used inline functions and were compiled to
assembly language.)

<A NAME="IDX1915"></A>
<DT><CODE>LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if <VAR>x</VAR> is a legitimate immediate

You can assume that <VAR>x</VAR> satisfies <CODE>CONSTANT_P</CODE>, so you need not
check this.  You can also assume <VAR>flag_pic</VAR> is true, so you need not
check it either.  You need not define this macro if all constants

position independent code.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>ASM_FILE_START (<VAR>stream</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1918"></A>
 
A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>
some appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
<SAMP>`#NO_APP'</SAMP>, which is a comment that has no effect on most
assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
checking for certain assembler constructs.

On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain commands;
see <TT>`attasm.h'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1919"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_FILE_END (<VAR>stream</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>
some appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.

If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
definition.

On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain commands;
see <TT>`attasm.h'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX1920"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify
the object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another
GNU compiler).

If you don't define this macro, the string <SAMP>`gcc_compiled.:'</SAMP>
is output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which,
on BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.
GDB checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the
symbol table of an executable.

On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
define this macro with an empty body.

<A NAME="IDX1921"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_COMMENT_START</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will end at
the end of the line.

<A NAME="IDX1922"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_APP_ON</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant for text to be output before each <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<CODE>"#APP"</CODE>, which is a comment that has no effect on most
assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines
that follow for all valid assembler constructs.

<A NAME="IDX1923"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_APP_OFF</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant for text to be output after each <CODE>asm</CODE>
statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
<CODE>"#NO_APP"</CODE>, which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler output.

<A NAME="IDX1924"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging information
which indicates that filename <VAR>name</VAR> is the current source file to
the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.

This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output
for the file format in use is appropriate.

<A NAME="IDX1925"></A>
<DT><CODE>OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output the string <VAR>string</VAR> to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR>.  If you do not call the function <CODE>output_quoted_string</CODE>
in your config files, GNU CC will only call it to output filenames to
the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
of the filename using this macro.

<A NAME="IDX1926"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>line</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before code
for line number <VAR>line</VAR> of the current source file to the
stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.

This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

<A NAME="IDX1927"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>string</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
<SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive containing the text <VAR>string</VAR>.  If this
macro is not defined, nothing is output for a <SAMP>`#ident'</SAMP> directive.

<A NAME="IDX1928"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>reloc</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch to section
<VAR>name</VAR> for object <VAR>decl</VAR> which is either a <CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE>, a
<CODE>VAR_DECL</CODE> or <CODE>NULL_TREE</CODE>.  <VAR>reloc</VAR>
indicates whether the initial value of <VAR>exp</VAR> requires link-time
relocations.  Some target formats do not support
arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in such cases.

At present this macro is only used to support section attributes.
When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.

<A NAME="IDX1929"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_PROLOGUE</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output any assembler statements which are required to
precede any Objective C object definitions or message sending.  The
statement is executed only when compiling an Objective C program.

<DD>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of <CODE>TFmode</CODE>,
<CODE>DFmode</CODE>, <CODE>SFmode</CODE>, <CODE>TQFmode</CODE>, <CODE>HFmode</CODE>, or
<CODE>QFmode</CODE>, respectively, whose value is <VAR>value</VAR>.  <VAR>value</VAR>
will be a C expression of type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>.  Macros such as
<CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE</CODE> are useful for writing these
definitions.

<DD>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
respectively, whose value is <VAR>value</VAR>.  The argument <VAR>exp</VAR> will
be an RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
<SAMP>`output_addr_const (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>exp</VAR>)'</SAMP> to output this value
as an assembler expression.
For sizes larger than <CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, if the action of a macro
would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
a size of <CODE>UNITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, once for each word, you need not define
the macro.

<A NAME="IDX1939"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number <VAR>value</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX1940"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_BYTE_OP</CODE>
<DD>
A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default is
<CODE>"byte"</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1941"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>ptr</VAR>, <VAR>len</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
instruction to assemble a string constant containing the <VAR>len</VAR>
bytes at <VAR>ptr</VAR>.  <VAR>ptr</VAR> will be a C expression of type
<CODE>char *</CODE> and <VAR>len</VAR> a C expression of type <CODE>int</CODE>.

If the assembler has a <CODE>.ascii</CODE> pseudo-op as found in the
Berkeley Unix assembler, do not define the macro
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1942"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION</CODE>
<DD>
You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
expression to have a non-zero value if GNU CC should output the constant
pool for a function before the code for the function, or a zero value if
GNU CC should output the constant pool after the function.  If you do
not define this macro, the usual case, GNU CC will output the constant
pool before the function.

<A NAME="IDX1943"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>funname</VAR> <VAR>fundecl</VAR> <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of the
constant pool for a function.  <VAR>funname</VAR> is a string giving
the name of the function.  Should the return type of the function
be required, it can be obtained via <VAR>fundecl</VAR>.  <VAR>size</VAR>
is the size, in bytes, of the constant pool that will be written
immediately after this call.

If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro need
not be defined.

<A NAME="IDX1944"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>align</VAR>, <VAR>labelno</VAR>, <VAR>jumpto</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in the
constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro need not do
anything for RTL expressions that can be output normally.)

The argument <VAR>file</VAR> is the standard I/O stream to output the
assembler code on.  <VAR>x</VAR> is the RTL expression for the constant to
output, and <VAR>mode</VAR> is the machine mode (in case <VAR>x</VAR> is a
<SAMP>`const_int'</SAMP>).  <VAR>align</VAR> is the required alignment for the value
<VAR>x</VAR>; you should output an assembler directive to force this much
alignment.

The argument <VAR>labelno</VAR> is a number to use in an internal label for
the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper place.
Here is how to do this:


<PRE>
ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>file</VAR>, "LC", <VAR>labelno</VAR>);
</PRE>

When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
<CODE>goto</CODE> to the label <VAR>jumpto</VAR>.  This will prevent the same pool
entry from being output a second time in the usual manner.

You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

<A NAME="IDX1945"></A>
<DT><CODE>CONSTANT_AFTER_FUNCTION_P (<VAR>exp</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if the constant
<VAR>exp</VAR>, of type <CODE>tree</CODE>, should be output after the code for a
function.  The compiler will normally output all constants before the
function; you need not define this macro if this is OK.

<A NAME="IDX1946"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (<VAR>file</VAR> <VAR>funname</VAR> <VAR>fundecl</VAR> <VAR>size</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the constant
pool for a function.  <VAR>funname</VAR> is a string giving the name of the
function.  Should the return type of the function be required, you can
obtain it via <VAR>fundecl</VAR>.  <VAR>size</VAR> is the size, in bytes, of the
constant pool that GNU CC wrote immediately before this call.

If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need not
define this macro.

<A NAME="IDX1947"></A>
<DT><CODE>IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (<VAR>C</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if <VAR>C</VAR> is
used as a logical line separator by the assembler.

If you do not define this macro, the default is that only
the character <SAMP>`;'</SAMP> is treated as a logical line separator.

<A NAME="IDX1948"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1949"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OPEN_PAREN</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>ASM_CLOSE_PAREN</CODE>
<DD>
These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the syntax
in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The following
definitions are correct for most assemblers:


<PRE>
#define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
#define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
  These macros are provided by <TT>`real.h'</TT> for writing the definitions
of <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE</CODE> and the like:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>l</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>l</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>l</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1950"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1951"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1952"></A>
These translate <VAR>x</VAR>, of type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>, to the target's
floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the array of
<CODE>long int</CODE> whose address is <VAR>l</VAR>.  The number of elements in the
output array is determined by the size of the desired target floating
point data type: 32 bits of it go in each <CODE>long int</CODE> array
element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
<CODE>long int</CODE> is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

The array element values are designed so that you can print them out
using <CODE>fprintf</CODE> in the order they should appear in the target
machine's memory.

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>format</VAR>, <VAR>string</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1953"></A>
This macro converts <VAR>x</VAR>, of type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>, to a
decimal number and stores it as a string into <VAR>string</VAR>.
You must pass, as <VAR>string</VAR>, the address of a long enough block
of space to hold the result.

The argument <VAR>format</VAR> is a <CODE>printf</CODE>-specification that serves
as a suggestion for how to format the output string.

A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> the assembler definition of a common-label named
<VAR>name</VAR> whose size is <VAR>size</VAR> bytes.  The variable <VAR>rounded</VAR>
is the size rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

Use the expression <CODE>assemble_name (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE> to

<A NAME="IDX1955"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>size</VAR>, <VAR>alignment</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>

is not corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use it
in place of both <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON</CODE> and
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON</CODE>.  Define this macro when you need to see

<VAR>stream</VAR> the assembler definition of uninitialized global <VAR>decl</VAR> named
<VAR>name</VAR> whose size is <VAR>size</VAR> bytes.  The variable <VAR>rounded</VAR>

<DT><CODE>ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> any text necessary for declaring the name <VAR>name</VAR> of an
initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must output the
label definition (perhaps using <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</CODE>).  The argument
<VAR>decl</VAR> is the <CODE>VAR_DECL</CODE> tree node representing the variable.

If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in the
usual manner as a label (by means of <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL</CODE>).

<A NAME="IDX1970"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>toplevel</VAR>, <VAR>atend</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable name
once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and thus has had a
chance to determine the size of an array when controlled by an
initializer.  This is used on systems where it's necessary to declare
something about the size of the object.

If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it to do
nothing.

<A NAME="IDX1971"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> some commands that will make the label <VAR>name</VAR> global;
that is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
<CODE>assemble_name (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE> to output the name
itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler syntax
for making that name global, and a newline.

<A NAME="IDX1972"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> some commands that will make the label <VAR>name</VAR> weak;
that is, available for reference from other files but only used if
no other definition is available.  Use the expression
<CODE>assemble_name (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE> to output the name
itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler syntax
for making that name weak, and a newline.

If you don't define this macro, GNU CC will not support weak
symbols and you should not define the <CODE>SUPPORTS_WEAK</CODE> macro.

<A NAME="IDX1973"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUPPORTS_WEAK</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak symbols.

If you don't define this macro, <TT>`defaults.h'</TT> provides a default
definition.  If <CODE>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</CODE> is defined, the default
definition is <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>; otherwise, it is <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.  Define this macro if
you want to control weak symbol support with a compiler flag such as
<SAMP>`-melf'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX1974"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark <VAR>decl</VAR> to be emitted as a
public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units will
be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object file
format provides support for this concept, such as the <SAMP>`COMDAT'</SAMP>
section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this support
requires changes to <VAR>decl</VAR>, such as putting it in a separate section.

<A NAME="IDX1975"></A>
<DT><CODE>SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports one-only
semantics.

If you don't define this macro, <TT>`varasm.c'</TT> provides a default
definition.  If <CODE>MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY</CODE> is defined, the default
definition is <SAMP>`1'</SAMP>; otherwise, it is <SAMP>`0'</SAMP>.  Define this macro if
you want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
setting the <CODE>DECL_ONE_ONLY</CODE> flag is enough to mark a declaration to
be emitted as one-only.

<A NAME="IDX1976"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
symbol named <VAR>name</VAR> which is referenced in this compilation but
not defined.  The value of <VAR>decl</VAR> is the tree node for the
declaration.

This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output anything.
The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require anything.

<A NAME="IDX1977"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>symref</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name of the
library function is given by <VAR>symref</VAR>, which has type <CODE>rtx</CODE> and
is a <CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>.

This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output anything.
The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't require anything.

<A NAME="IDX1978"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> a reference in assembler syntax to a label named
<VAR>name</VAR>.  This should add <SAMP>`_'</SAMP> to the front of the name, if that
is customary on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix
systems.  This macro is used in <CODE>assemble_name</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX1979"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> a label whose
name is made from the string <VAR>prefix</VAR> and the number <VAR>num</VAR>.

It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the labels
used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise, certain programs
will have name conflicts with internal labels.

It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table of the
object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for labels that
should be excluded; on many systems, the letter <SAMP>`L'</SAMP> at the
beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
convention your system uses, and follow it.

The usual definition of this macro is as follows:


<PRE>
fprintf (<VAR>stream</VAR>, "L%s%d:\n", <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX1980"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>prefix</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to store into the string <VAR>string</VAR> a label whose name
is made from the string <VAR>prefix</VAR> and the number <VAR>num</VAR>.

This string, when output subsequently by <CODE>assemble_name</CODE>, should
produce the output that <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> would produce
with the same <VAR>prefix</VAR> and <VAR>num</VAR>.

If the string begins with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then <CODE>assemble_name</CODE> will
output the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
<CODE>ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE> to use <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> in this way.  If the
string doesn't start with <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, then <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> gets
to output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> is also part of your machine description, so
you should know what it does on your machine.)

<A NAME="IDX1981"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (<VAR>outvar</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>number</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression to assign to <VAR>outvar</VAR> (which is a variable of type
<CODE>char *</CODE>) a newly allocated string made from the string
<VAR>name</VAR> and the number <VAR>number</VAR>, with some suitable punctuation
added.  Use <CODE>alloca</CODE> to get space for the string.

The string will be used as an argument to <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF</CODE> to
produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose name is
<VAR>name</VAR>.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in valid
assembler code.  The argument <VAR>number</VAR> is different each time this
macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between similarly-named
internal static variables in different scopes.

Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent any
conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow periods
or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least one of these
between the name and the number will suffice.

<A NAME="IDX1982"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> assembler code
which defines (equates) the symbol <VAR>name</VAR> to have the value <VAR>value</VAR>.

If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
correct for most systems.

<A NAME="IDX1983"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DEFINE_LABEL_DIFFERENCE_SYMBOL (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>symbol</VAR>, <VAR>high</VAR>, <VAR>low</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> assembler code
which defines (equates) the symbol <VAR>symbol</VAR> to have a value equal to
the difference of the two symbols <VAR>high</VAR> and <VAR>low</VAR>, i.e.
<VAR>high</VAR> minus <VAR>low</VAR>.  GNU CC guarantees that the symbols <VAR>high</VAR>
and <VAR>low</VAR> are already known by the assembler so that the difference
resolves into a constant.

If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
correct for most systems.

<A NAME="IDX1984"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> assembler code
which defines (equates) the weak symbol <VAR>name</VAR> to have the value
<VAR>value</VAR>.

Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
ASM_OUTPUT_DEF instead if possible.

<A NAME="IDX1985"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (<VAR>buf</VAR>, <VAR>is_inst</VAR>, <VAR>class_name</VAR>, <VAR>cat_name</VAR>, <VAR>sel_name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
Objective C methods.

The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of the
class (e.g. <SAMP>`_1_Foo'</SAMP>).  For methods in categories, the name of
the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
<SAMP>`_1_Foo_Bar'</SAMP>).

These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult since
the method's selector is not present in the name.  Therefore, particular
systems define other ways of computing names.

<VAR>buf</VAR> is an expression of type <CODE>char *</CODE> which gives you a
buffer in which to store the name; its length is as long as
<VAR>class_name</VAR>, <VAR>cat_name</VAR> and <VAR>sel_name</VAR> put together, plus
50 characters extra.

The argument <VAR>is_inst</VAR> specifies whether the method is an instance
method or a class method; <VAR>class_name</VAR> is the name of the class;
<VAR>cat_name</VAR> is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
in a category); and <VAR>sel_name</VAR> is the name of the selector.

On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can use this
macro to provide more human-readable names.

<H3><A NAME="SEC237" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC237">How Initialization Functions Are Handled</A></H3>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1986"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1987"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1988"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1989"></A>

</P>
<P>
The compiled code for certain languages includes <STRONG>constructors</STRONG>
(also called <STRONG>initialization routines</STRONG>)---functions to initialize
data in the program when the program is started.  These functions need
to be called before the program is "started"---that is to say, before
<CODE>main</CODE> is called.

</P>
<P>
Compiling some languages generates <STRONG>destructors</STRONG> (also called
<STRONG>termination routines</STRONG>) that should be called when the program
terminates.

</P>
<P>
To make the initialization and termination functions work, the compiler
must output something in the assembler code to cause those functions to
be called at the appropriate time.  When you port the compiler to a new
system, you need to specify how to do this.

</P>
<P>
There are two major ways that GCC currently supports the execution of
initialization and termination functions.  Each way has two variants.
Much of the structure is common to all four variations.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1990"></A>
<A NAME="IDX1991"></A>
The linker must build two lists of these functions--a list of
initialization functions, called <CODE>__CTOR_LIST__</CODE>, and a list of
termination functions, called <CODE>__DTOR_LIST__</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Each list always begins with an ignored function pointer (which may hold
0, -1, or a count of the function pointers after it, depending on
the environment).  This is followed by a series of zero or more function
pointers to constructors (or destructors), followed by a function
pointer containing zero.

</P>
<P>
Depending on the operating system and its executable file format, either
<TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> or <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> traverses these lists at startup
time and exit time.  Constructors are called in reverse order of the
list; destructors in forward order.

</P>
<P>
The best way to handle static constructors works only for object file
formats which provide arbitrarily-named sections.  A section is set
aside for a list of constructors, and another for a list of destructors.
Traditionally these are called <SAMP>`.ctors'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`.dtors'</SAMP>.  Each
object file that defines an initialization function also puts a word in
the constructor section to point to that function.  The linker
accumulates all these words into one contiguous <SAMP>`.ctors'</SAMP> section.
Termination functions are handled similarly.

</P>
<P>
To use this method, you need appropriate definitions of the macros
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> and <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE>.  Usually
you can get them by including <TT>`svr4.h'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When arbitrary sections are available, there are two variants, depending
upon how the code in <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> is called.  On systems that
support an <STRONG>init</STRONG> section which is executed at program startup,
parts of <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> are compiled into that section.  The
program is linked by the <CODE>gcc</CODE> driver like this:

</P>

<PRE>
ld -o <VAR>output_file</VAR> crtbegin.o ... crtend.o -lgcc
</PRE>

<P>
The head of a function (<CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE>) appears in the init
section of <TT>`crtbegin.o'</TT>; the remainder of the function appears in
the init section of <TT>`crtend.o'</TT>.  The linker will pull these two
parts of the section together, making a whole function.  If any of the
user's object files linked into the middle of it contribute code, then that
code will be executed as part of the body of <CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
To use this variant, you must define the <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>
macro properly.

</P>
<P>
If no init section is available, do not define
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>.  Then <CODE>__do_global_ctors</CODE> is built into
the text section like all other functions, and resides in
<TT>`libgcc.a'</TT>.  When GCC compiles any function called <CODE>main</CODE>, it
inserts a procedure call to <CODE>__main</CODE> as the first executable code
after the function prologue.  The <CODE>__main</CODE> function, also defined
in <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT>, simply calls <TT>`__do_global_ctors'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
In file formats that don't support arbitrary sections, there are again
two variants.  In the simplest variant, the GNU linker (GNU <CODE>ld</CODE>)
and an `a.out' format must be used.  In this case,
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> is defined to produce a <CODE>.stabs</CODE>
entry of type <SAMP>`N_SETT'</SAMP>, referencing the name <CODE>__CTOR_LIST__</CODE>,
and with the address of the void function containing the initialization
code as its value.  The GNU linker recognizes this as a request to add
the value to a "set"; the values are accumulated, and are eventually
placed in the executable as a vector in the format described above, with
a leading (ignored) count and a trailing zero element.
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE> is handled similarly.  Since no init
section is available, the absence of <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> causes
the compilation of <CODE>main</CODE> to call <CODE>__main</CODE> as above, starting
the initialization process.

</P>
<P>
The last variant uses neither arbitrary sections nor the GNU linker.
This is preferable when you want to do dynamic linking and when using
file formats which the GNU linker does not support, such as `ECOFF'.  In
this case, <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> does not produce an
<CODE>N_SETT</CODE> symbol; initialization and termination functions are
recognized simply by their names.  This requires an extra program in the
linkage step, called <CODE>collect2</CODE>.  This program pretends to be the
linker, for use with GNU CC; it does its job by running the ordinary
linker, but also arranges to include the vectors of initialization and
termination functions.  These functions are called via <CODE>__main</CODE> as
described above.

</P>
<P>
Choosing among these configuration options has been simplified by a set
of operating-system-dependent files in the <TT>`config'</TT> subdirectory.
These files define all of the relevant parameters.  Usually it is
sufficient to include one into your specific machine-dependent
configuration file.  These files are:

<H3><A NAME="SEC238" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC238">Macros Controlling Initialization Routines</A></H3>

<P>
Here are the macros that control how the compiler handles initialization
and termination functions:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1992"></A>
 
If defined, a C string constant for the assembler operation to identify
the following data as initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will
assume such a section does not exist.  When you are using special
sections for initialization and termination functions, this macro also
controls how <TT>`crtstuff.c'</TT> and <TT>`libgcc2.c'</TT> arrange to run the
initialization functions.

<DT><CODE>HAS_INIT_SECTION</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1993"></A>
If defined, <CODE>main</CODE> will not call <CODE>__main</CODE> as described above.
This macro should be defined for systems that control the contents of the
init section on a symbol-by-symbol basis, such as OSF/1, and should not
be defined explicitly for systems that support
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>LD_INIT_SWITCH</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1994"></A>
If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker that
the following symbol is an initialization routine.

<DT><CODE>LD_FINI_SWITCH</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1995"></A>
If defined, a C string constant for a switch that tells the linker that
the following symbol is a finalization routine.

<DT><CODE>INVOKE__main</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1996"></A>
If defined, <CODE>main</CODE> will call <CODE>__main</CODE> despite the presence of
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE>.  This macro should be defined for systems
where the init section is not actually run automatically, but is still
useful for collecting the lists of constructors and destructors.

<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1997"></A>
Define this macro as a C statement to output on the stream <VAR>stream</VAR>
the assembler code to arrange to call the function named <VAR>name</VAR> at
initialization time.

Assume that <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of a C function generated
automatically by the compiler.  This function takes no arguments.  Use
the function <CODE>assemble_name</CODE> to output the name <VAR>name</VAR>; this
performs any system-specific syntactic transformations such as adding an
underscore.

If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output to arrange to
call the function.  This is correct when the function will be called in
some other manner--for example, by means of the <CODE>collect2</CODE> program,
which looks through the symbol table to find these functions by their
names.

<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1998"></A>
This is like <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> but used for termination
functions rather than initialization functions.

When <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> and <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE> are
defined, the initializaiton routine generated for the generated object
file will have static linkage.
</DL>

<P>
If your system uses <CODE>collect2</CODE> as the means of processing
constructors, then that program normally uses <CODE>nm</CODE> to scan an
object file for constructor functions to be called.  On such systems you
must not define <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CONSTRUCTOR</CODE> and <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_DESTRUCTOR</CODE>
as the object file's initialization routine must have global scope.

</P>
<P>
On certain kinds of systems, you can define these macros to make
<CODE>collect2</CODE> work faster (and, in some cases, make it work at all):

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>OBJECT_FORMAT_COFF</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX1999"></A>
 
Define this macro if the system uses COFF (Common Object File Format)
object files, so that <CODE>collect2</CODE> can assume this format and scan
object files directly for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.

<A NAME="IDX2000"></A>
<DT><CODE>OBJECT_FORMAT_ROSE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the system uses ROSE format object files, so that
<CODE>collect2</CODE> can assume this format and scan object files directly
for dynamic constructor/destructor functions.

These macros are effective only in a native compiler; <CODE>collect2</CODE> as
part of a cross compiler always uses <CODE>nm</CODE> for the target machine.

<A NAME="IDX2001"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_NM_FILE_NAME</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant containing the file name to use
to execute <CODE>nm</CODE>.  The default is to search the path normally for
<CODE>nm</CODE>.

If your system supports shared libraries and has a program to list the
dynamic dependencies of a given library or executable, you can define
these macros to enable support for running initialization and
termination functions in shared libraries:

<A NAME="IDX2002"></A>
<DT><CODE>LDD_SUFFIX</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to a C string constant containing the name of the
program which lists dynamic dependencies, like <CODE>"ldd"</CODE> under SunOS 4.

<A NAME="IDX2003"></A>
<DT><CODE>PARSE_LDD_OUTPUT (<VAR>PTR</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be C code that extracts filenames from the output
of the program denoted by <CODE>LDD_SUFFIX</CODE>.  <VAR>PTR</VAR> is a variable
of type <CODE>char *</CODE> that points to the beginning of a line of output
from <CODE>LDD_SUFFIX</CODE>.  If the line lists a dynamic dependency, the
code must advance <VAR>PTR</VAR> to the beginning of the filename on that
line.  Otherwise, it must set <VAR>PTR</VAR> to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC239" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC239">Output of Assembler Instructions</A></H3>

<P>
This describes assembler instruction output.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2004"></A>
 
A C initializer containing the assembler's names for the machine
registers, each one as a C string constant.  This is what translates
register numbers in the compiler into assembler language.

<A NAME="IDX2005"></A>
<DT><CODE>ADDITIONAL_REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C initializer for an array of structures containing a name
and a register number.  This macro defines additional names for hard
registers, thus allowing the <CODE>asm</CODE> option in declarations to refer
to registers using alternate names.

<A NAME="IDX2006"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_OPCODE (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>ptr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you are using an unusual assembler that
requires different names for the machine instructions.

The definition is a C statement or statements which output an
assembler instruction opcode to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.  The
macro-operand <VAR>ptr</VAR> is a variable of type <CODE>char *</CODE> which
points to the opcode name in its "internal" form--the form that is
written in the machine description.  The definition should output the
opcode name to <VAR>stream</VAR>, performing any translation you desire, and
increment the variable <VAR>ptr</VAR> to point at the end of the opcode
so that it will not be output twice.

In fact, your macro definition may process less than the entire opcode
name, or more than the opcode name; but if you want to process text
that includes <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>-sequences to substitute operands, you must take
care of the substitution yourself.  Just be sure to increment
<VAR>ptr</VAR> over whatever text should not be output normally.

<A NAME="IDX2007"></A>
If you need to look at the operand values, they can be found as the
elements of <CODE>recog_operand</CODE>.

If the macro definition does nothing, the instruction is output
in the usual way.

<A NAME="IDX2008"></A>
<DT><CODE>FINAL_PRESCAN_INSN (<VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>opvec</VAR>, <VAR>noperands</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C statement to be executed just prior to the output of
assembler code for <VAR>insn</VAR>, to modify the extracted operands so
they will be output differently.

Here the argument <VAR>opvec</VAR> is the vector containing the operands
extracted from <VAR>insn</VAR>, and <VAR>noperands</VAR> is the number of
elements of the vector which contain meaningful data for this insn.
The contents of this vector are what will be used to convert the insn
template into assembler code, so you can change the assembler output
by changing the contents of the vector.

This macro is useful when various assembler syntaxes share a single
file of instruction patterns; by defining this macro differently, you
can cause a large class of instructions to be output differently (such
as with rearranged operands).  Naturally, variations in assembler
syntax affecting individual insn patterns ought to be handled by
writing conditional output routines in those patterns.

If this macro is not defined, it is equivalent to a null statement.

<DT><CODE>FINAL_PRESCAN_LABEL</CODE>

<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand <VAR>x</VAR>.  <VAR>x</VAR> is an
RTL expression.

<VAR>code</VAR> is a value that can be used to specify one of several ways
of printing the operand.  It is used when identical operands must be
printed differently depending on the context.  <VAR>code</VAR> comes from
the <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> specification that was used to request printing of the
operand.  If the specification was just <SAMP>`%<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> then
<VAR>code</VAR> is 0; if the specification was <SAMP>`%<VAR>ltr</VAR>
<VAR>digit</VAR>'</SAMP> then <VAR>code</VAR> is the ASCII code for <VAR>ltr</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2011"></A>
If <VAR>x</VAR> is a register, this macro should print the register's name.
The names can be found in an array <CODE>reg_names</CODE> whose type is
<CODE>char *[]</CODE>.  <CODE>reg_names</CODE> is initialized from
<CODE>REGISTER_NAMES</CODE>.

When the machine description has a specification <SAMP>`%<VAR>punct</VAR>'</SAMP>
(a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP> followed by a punctuation character), this macro is called
with a null pointer for <VAR>x</VAR> and the punctuation character for
<VAR>code</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2012"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P (<VAR>code</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which evaluates to true if <VAR>code</VAR> is a valid
punctuation character for use in the <CODE>PRINT_OPERAND</CODE> macro.  If
<CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_PUNCT_VALID_P</CODE> is not defined, it means that no
punctuation characters (except for the standard one, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>) are used
in this way.

<A NAME="IDX2013"></A>
<DT><CODE>PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C compound statement to output to stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> the
assembler syntax for an instruction operand that is a memory reference
whose address is <VAR>x</VAR>.  <VAR>x</VAR> is an RTL expression.

<A NAME="IDX2014"></A>
On some machines, the syntax for a symbolic address depends on the
section that the address refers to.  On these machines, define the macro
<CODE>ENCODE_SECTION_INFO</CODE> to store the information into the
<CODE>symbol_ref</CODE>, and then check for it here.  See section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC232">Defining the Output Assembler Language</A>.

<A NAME="IDX2015"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2016"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBR_OUTPUT_SEQEND(<VAR>file</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement, to be executed after all slot-filler instructions have
been output.  If necessary, call <CODE>dbr_sequence_length</CODE> to
determine the number of slots filled in a sequence (zero if not
currently outputting a sequence), to decide how many no-ops to output,
or whatever.

Don't define this macro if it has nothing to do, but it is helpful in
reading assembly output if the extent of the delay sequence is made
explicit (e.g. with white space).

<A NAME="IDX2017"></A>
Note that output routines for instructions with delay slots must be
prepared to deal with not being output as part of a sequence (i.e.
when the scheduling pass is not run, or when no slot fillers could be
found.)  The variable <CODE>final_sequence</CODE> is null when not
processing a sequence, otherwise it contains the <CODE>sequence</CODE> rtx
being output.

<DT><CODE>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</CODE>
<DD>
If your target supports multiple dialects of assembler language (such as
different opcodes), define this macro as a C expression that gives the
numeric index of the assembler language dialect to use, with zero as the
first variant.

If this macro is defined, you may use constructs of the form
<SAMP>`{option0|option1|option2...}'</SAMP> in the output
templates of patterns (see section <A HREF="gcc_16.html#SEC173">Output Templates and Operand Substitution</A>) or in the first argument
of <CODE>asm_fprintf</CODE>.  This construct outputs <SAMP>`option0'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`option1'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`option2'</SAMP>, etc., if the value of
<CODE>ASSEMBLER_DIALECT</CODE> is zero, one or two, etc.  Any special
characters within these strings retain their usual meaning.

If you do not define this macro, the characters <SAMP>`{'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`|'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`}'</SAMP> do not have any special meaning when used in templates or
operands to <CODE>asm_fprintf</CODE>.

Define the macros <CODE>REGISTER_PREFIX</CODE>, <CODE>LOCAL_LABEL_PREFIX</CODE>,
<CODE>USER_LABEL_PREFIX</CODE> and <CODE>IMMEDIATE_PREFIX</CODE> if you can express
the variations in assembler language syntax with that mechanism.  Define

if the syntax variant are larger and involve such things as different
opcodes or operand order.

A C statement to output to the stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler
pseudo-instruction to generate a difference between two labels.
<VAR>value</VAR> and <VAR>rel</VAR> are the numbers of two internal labels.  The
definitions of these labels are output using
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE>, and they must be printed in the same
way here.  For example,


<PRE>
fprintf (<VAR>stream</VAR>, "\t.word L%d-L%d\n",
         <VAR>value</VAR>, <VAR>rel</VAR>)
</PRE>

You must provide this macro on machines where the addresses in a
dispatch table are relative to the table's own address.  If defined, GNU
CC will also use this macro on all machines when producing PIC.
<VAR>body</VAR> is the body of the ADDR_DIFF_VEC; it is provided so that the

This macro should be provided on machines where the addresses
in a dispatch table are absolute.

The definition should be a C statement to output to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> an assembler pseudo-instruction to generate a reference to
a label.  <VAR>value</VAR> is the number of an internal label whose
definition is output using <CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE>.

<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE>; the fourth argument is the
jump-table which follows (a <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> containing an
<CODE>addr_vec</CODE> or <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE>).

This feature is used on system V to output a <CODE>swbeg</CODE> statement

If this macro is not defined, these labels are output with
<CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2030"></A>
<DT><CODE>ASM_OUTPUT_CASE_END (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>num</VAR>, <VAR>table</VAR>)</CODE>

after the assembler code for the table is written.  It should write
the appropriate code to stdio stream <VAR>stream</VAR>.  The argument
<VAR>table</VAR> is the jump-table insn, and <VAR>num</VAR> is the label-number

These macros affect all debugging formats.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER (<VAR>regno</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2047"></A>
 
A C expression that returns the DBX register number for the compiler
register number <VAR>regno</VAR>.  In simple cases, the value of this
expression may be <VAR>regno</VAR> itself.  But sometimes there are some
registers that the compiler knows about and DBX does not, or vice
versa.  In such cases, some register may need to have one number in
the compiler and another for DBX.

If two registers have consecutive numbers inside GNU CC, and they can be
used as a pair to hold a multiword value, then they <EM>must</EM> have
consecutive numbers after renumbering with <CODE>DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER</CODE>.
Otherwise, debuggers will be unable to access such a pair, because they
expect register pairs to be consecutive in their own numbering scheme.

If you find yourself defining <CODE>DBX_REGISTER_NUMBER</CODE> in way that
does not preserve register pairs, then what you must do instead is
redefine the actual register numbering scheme.

<A NAME="IDX2048"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEBUGGER_AUTO_OFFSET (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an automatic
variable having address <VAR>x</VAR> (an RTL expression).  The default
computation assumes that <VAR>x</VAR> is based on the frame-pointer and
gives the offset from the frame-pointer.  This is required for targets
that produce debugging output for DBX or COFF-style debugging output
for SDB and allow the frame-pointer to be eliminated when the
<SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> options is used.

<A NAME="IDX2049"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEBUGGER_ARG_OFFSET (<VAR>offset</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns the integer offset value for an argument
having address <VAR>x</VAR> (an RTL expression).  The nominal offset is
<VAR>offset</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2050"></A>
<DT><CODE>PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns the type of debugging output GNU CC should
produce when the user specifies just <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP>.  Define
this if you have arranged for GNU CC to support more than one format of
debugging output.  Currently, the allowable values are <CODE>DBX_DEBUG</CODE>,
<CODE>SDB_DEBUG</CODE>, <CODE>DWARF_DEBUG</CODE>, <CODE>DWARF2_DEBUG</CODE>, and
<CODE>XCOFF_DEBUG</CODE>.

When the user specifies <SAMP>`-ggdb'</SAMP>, GNU CC normally also uses the
value of this macro to select the debugging output format, but with two
exceptions.  If <CODE>DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE> is defined and
<CODE>LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2</CODE> is not defined, GNU CC uses the
value <CODE>DWARF2_DEBUG</CODE>.  Otherwise, if <CODE>DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE> is
defined, GNU CC uses <CODE>DBX_DEBUG</CODE>.

The value of this macro only affects the default debugging output; the
user can always get a specific type of output by using <SAMP>`-gstabs'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`-gcoff'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gdwarf-1'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`-gdwarf-2'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`-gxcoff'</SAMP>.

first.

<A NAME="IDX2069"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_BLOCKS_FUNCTION_RELATIVE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the value of a symbol describing the scope of a
block (<CODE>N_LBRAC</CODE> or <CODE>N_RBRAC</CODE>) should be relative to the start
of the enclosing function.  Normally, GNU C uses an absolute address.

<A NAME="IDX2070"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_USE_BINCL</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if GNU C should generate <CODE>N_BINCL</CODE> and
<CODE>N_EINCL</CODE> stabs for included header files, as on Sun systems.  This
macro also directs GNU C to output a type number as a pair of a file
number and a type number within the file.  Normally, GNU C does not
generate <CODE>N_BINCL</CODE> or <CODE>N_EINCL</CODE> stabs, and it outputs a single
number for a type number.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2071"></A>
 
Define this macro to say how to output to <VAR>stream</VAR> the debugging
information for the start of a scope level for variable names.  The
argument <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of an assembler symbol (for use with
<CODE>assemble_name</CODE>) whose value is the address where the scope begins.

<A NAME="IDX2072"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_RBRAC (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Like <CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_LBRAC</CODE>, but for the end of a scope level.

<A NAME="IDX2073"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_ENUM (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine requires special handling to
output an enumeration type.  The definition should be a C statement
(sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information to <VAR>stream</VAR>
for the type <VAR>type</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2074"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_FUNCTION_END (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>function</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target machine requires special output at the
end of the debugging information for a function.  The definition should
be a C statement (sans semicolon) to output the appropriate information
to <VAR>stream</VAR>.  <VAR>function</VAR> is the <CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE> node for
the function.

<A NAME="IDX2075"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES (<VAR>syms</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you need to control the order of output of the
standard data types at the beginning of compilation.  The argument
<VAR>syms</VAR> is a <CODE>tree</CODE> which is a chain of all the predefined
global symbols, including names of data types.

Normally, DBX output starts with definitions of the types for integers
and characters, followed by all the other predefined types of the
particular language in no particular order.

On some machines, it is necessary to output different particular types
first.  To do this, define <CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_STANDARD_TYPES</CODE> to output
those symbols in the necessary order.  Any predefined types that you
don't explicitly output will be output afterward in no particular order.

Be careful not to define this macro so that it works only for C.  There
are no global variables to access most of the built-in types, because
another language may have another set of types.  The way to output a
particular type is to look through <VAR>syms</VAR> to see if you can find it.
Here is an example:


<PRE>
{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (!strcmp (IDENTIFIER_POINTER (DECL_NAME (decl)),
                 "long int"))
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  ...
}
</PRE>

This does nothing if the expected type does not exist.

See the function <CODE>init_decl_processing</CODE> in <TT>`c-decl.c'</TT> to find
the names to use for all the built-in C types.

Here is another way of finding a particular type:


<PRE>
{
  tree decl;
  for (decl = syms; decl; decl = TREE_CHAIN (decl))
    if (TREE_CODE (decl) == TYPE_DECL
        &#38;&#38; (TREE_CODE (TREE_TYPE (decl))
            == INTEGER_CST)
        &#38;&#38; TYPE_PRECISION (TREE_TYPE (decl)) == 16
        &#38;&#38; TYPE_UNSIGNED (TREE_TYPE (decl)))
      /* This must be <CODE>unsigned short</CODE>.  */
      dbxout_symbol (decl);
  ...
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="IDX2076"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_DBX_FUNCTION_END</CODE>
<DD>
Some stabs encapsulation formats (in particular ECOFF), cannot handle the
<CODE>.stabs "",N_FUN,,0,0,Lscope-function-1</CODE> gdb dbx extention construct.
On those machines, define this macro to turn this feature off without
disturbing the rest of the gdb extensions.

A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> which indicates that file <VAR>name</VAR> is the main source
file--the file specified as the input file for compilation.
This macro is called only once, at the beginning of compilation.

This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output

<A NAME="IDX2079"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_DIRECTORY (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>

<A NAME="IDX2080"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_MAIN_SOURCE_FILE_END (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output DBX debugging information at the end of

If you don't define this macro, nothing special is output at the end
of compilation, which is correct for most machines.

<A NAME="IDX2081"></A>
<DT><CODE>DBX_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (<VAR>stream</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement to output DBX debugging information to the stdio stream
<VAR>stream</VAR> which indicates that file <VAR>name</VAR> is the current source
file.  This output is generated each time input shifts to a different
source file as a result of <SAMP>`#include'</SAMP>, the end of an included file,

Here are macros for SDB and DWARF output.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>SDB_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2082"></A>
 
Define this macro if GNU CC should produce COFF-style debugging output
for SDB in response to the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option.

<A NAME="IDX2083"></A>
<DT><CODE>DWARF_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE>

Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf format debugging output
in response to the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option.

<A NAME="IDX2084"></A>
<DT><CODE>DWARF2_DEBUGGING_INFO</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if GNU CC should produce dwarf version 2 format
debugging output in response to the <SAMP>`-g'</SAMP> option.

To support optional call frame debugging information, you must also
define <CODE>INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX</CODE> and either set
<CODE>RTX_FRAME_RELATED_P</CODE> on the prologue insns if you use RTL for the
prologue, or call <CODE>dwarf2out_def_cfa</CODE> and <CODE>dwarf2out_reg_save</CODE>
as appropriate from <CODE>FUNCTION_PROLOGUE</CODE> if you don't.

<A NAME="IDX2085"></A>
<DT><CODE>DWARF2_FRAME_INFO</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to a nonzero value if GNU CC should always output
Dwarf 2 frame information.  If <CODE>DWARF2_UNWIND_INFO</CODE>
(see section <A HREF="gcc_17.html#SEC241">Assembler Commands for Exception Regions</A> is nonzero, GNU CC will output this
information not matter how you define <CODE>DWARF2_FRAME_INFO</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2086"></A>
<DT><CODE>LINKER_DOES_NOT_WORK_WITH_DWARF2</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the linker does not work with Dwarf version 2.
Normally, if the user specifies only <SAMP>`-ggdb'</SAMP> GNU CC will use Dwarf
version 2 if available; this macro disables this.  See the description
of the <CODE>PREFERRED_DEBUGGING_TYPE</CODE> macro for more details.

<A NAME="IDX2087"></A>
<DT><CODE>PUT_SDB_...</CODE>
<DD>
Define these macros to override the assembler syntax for the special
SDB assembler directives.  See <TT>`sdbout.c'</TT> for a list of these
macros and their arguments.  If the standard syntax is used, you need
not define them yourself.

<A NAME="IDX2088"></A>
<DT><CODE>SDB_DELIM</CODE>
<DD>
Some assemblers do not support a semicolon as a delimiter, even between
SDB assembler directives.  In that case, define this macro to be the
delimiter to use (usually <SAMP>`\n'</SAMP>).  It is not necessary to define
a new set of <CODE>PUT_SDB_<VAR>op</VAR></CODE> macros if this is the only change
required.

<A NAME="IDX2089"></A>
<DT><CODE>SDB_GENERATE_FAKE</CODE>

more information.

<A NAME="IDX2090"></A>
<DT><CODE>SDB_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_REFERENCES</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to allow references to unknown structure,
union, or enumeration tags to be emitted.  Standard COFF does not
allow handling of unknown references, MIPS ECOFF has support for
it.

<A NAME="IDX2091"></A>
<DT><CODE>SDB_ALLOW_FORWARD_REFERENCES</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to allow references to structure, union, or
enumeration tags that have not yet been seen to be handled.  Some
assemblers choke if forward tags are used, while some require it.

<H2><A NAME="SEC249" HREF="gcc_toc.html#TOC249">Cross Compilation and Floating Point</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2092"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2093"></A>

</P>
<P>
While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for integers,
there are a variety of representations for floating point numbers.  This
means that in a cross-compiler the representation of floating point numbers
in the compiled program may be different from that used in the machine
doing the compilation.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2094"></A>
Because different representation systems may offer different amounts of
range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point constants
must be represented in the target machine's format.  This means that the
cross compiler cannot use <CODE>atof</CODE> to parse a floating point constant;
it must have its own special routine to use instead.  Also, constant
folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or must not be done
at all).

</P>
<P>
The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are cross
compiling between different floating point formats.

</P>
<P>
Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set up which
use <CODE>double</CODE> as the data type, <CODE>==</CODE> to test for equality, etc.

</P>
<P>
You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of any
of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side effects.

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2095"></A>
 
A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point value

integer.

<A NAME="IDX2100"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_FIX (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the target-machine
floating point value <VAR>x</VAR> towards zero to an integer value (but still
as a floating point number).  <VAR>x</VAR> has type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>,
and so does the value.

<A NAME="IDX2103"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the target-machine
floating point value <VAR>x</VAR> towards zero to an unsigned integer value
(but still represented as a floating point number).  <VAR>x</VAR> has type
<CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>, and so does the value.

<A NAME="IDX2104"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_ATOF (<VAR>string</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which converts <VAR>string</VAR>, an expression of
type <CODE>char *</CODE>, into a floating point number in the target machine's
representation for mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.  The value has type
<CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2105"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_INFINITY</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value, and
therefore division by 0 is legitimate.

<A NAME="IDX2106"></A>

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_ISINF (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which determines whether <VAR>x</VAR>, a floating

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which determines whether <VAR>x</VAR>, a floating

<CODE>int</CODE>.  By default, this is defined to call <CODE>isnan</CODE>.
</DL>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX2110"></A>
Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't

<DT><CODE>REAL_ARITHMETIC (<VAR>output</VAR>, <VAR>code</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>y</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2111"></A>
 
A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation of
the two floating point values <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>, both of type
<CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> in the target machine's representation, to
produce a result of the same type and representation which is stored
in <VAR>output</VAR> (which will be a variable).

The operation to be performed is specified by <VAR>code</VAR>, a tree code
which will always be one of the following: <CODE>PLUS_EXPR</CODE>,
<CODE>MINUS_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>MULT_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>RDIV_EXPR</CODE>,
<CODE>MAX_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>MIN_EXPR</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX2112"></A>
The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for overflow.
If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute the statement
<CODE>return 0;</CODE>, which indicates the inability to perform the
arithmetic operation requested.

<A NAME="IDX2113"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (<VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the floating
point value <VAR>x</VAR>.  Both <VAR>x</VAR> and the value of the expression
have type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE> and are in the target machine's
floating point representation.

There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
can't happen in the negation operation.

<A NAME="IDX2114"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (<VAR>mode</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
<VAR>x</VAR> to mode <VAR>mode</VAR>.

Both <VAR>x</VAR> and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
floating point representation and have type <CODE>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</CODE>.
However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be output
properly as a floating constant whose precision accords with mode
<VAR>mode</VAR>.

There is no way for this macro to report overflow.

<A NAME="IDX2115"></A>
<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (<VAR>low</VAR>, <VAR>high</VAR>, <VAR>x</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value
<VAR>x</VAR> into a double-precision integer which is then stored into
<VAR>low</VAR> and <VAR>high</VAR>, two variables of type <VAR>int</VAR>.

<DT><CODE>REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (<VAR>x</VAR>, <VAR>low</VAR>, <VAR>high</VAR>, <VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2116"></A>
A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision integer
found in <VAR>low</VAR> and <VAR>high</VAR>, two variables of type <VAR>int</VAR>,
into a floating point value which is then stored into <VAR>x</VAR>.
The value is in the target machine's representation for mode <VAR>mode</VAR>

<P>
Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>PREDICATE_CODES</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2118"></A>
Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the file
<TT>`<VAR>machine</VAR>.c'</TT>.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name of a
predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For each
predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions matched by the
predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.  Here is an example
of two entries in the list for a typical RISC machine:


<PRE>
#define PREDICATE_CODES \
  {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
  {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},
</PRE>

Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by the
predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it allows
the table built by <TT>`genrecog'</TT> to be more compact and efficient,
thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important predicates to include
in the list specified by this macro are those used in the most insn
patterns.

<A NAME="IDX2119"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VECTOR_MODE</CODE>
<DD>
An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
elements of a jump-table should have.

<A NAME="IDX2120"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VECTOR_SHORTEN_MODE (<VAR>min_offset</VAR>, <VAR>max_offset</VAR>, <VAR>body</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Optional: return the preferred mode for an <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE>
when the minimum and maximum offset are known.  If you define this,
it enables extra code in branch shortening to deal with <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE>.
To make this work, you also have to define INSN_ALIGN and 
make the alignment for <CODE>addr_diff_vec</CODE> explicit.
The <VAR>body</VAR> argument is provided so that the offset_unsigned and scale
flags can be updated.

<A NAME="IDX2121"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be a C expression to indicate when jump-tables
should contain relative addresses.  If jump-tables never contain
relative addresses, then you need not define this macro.

<A NAME="IDX2122"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_DROPS_THROUGH</CODE>
<DD>
Define this if control falls through a <CODE>case</CODE> insn when the index
value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
actually ignored by the <CODE>case</CODE> insn proper.

<A NAME="IDX2123"></A>
<DT><CODE>CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD</CODE>
<DD>
Define this to be the smallest number of different values for which it
is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.
The default is four for machines with a <CODE>casesi</CODE> instruction and
five otherwise.  This is best for most machines.

<A NAME="IDX2124"></A>
<DT><CODE>WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if operations between registers with integral mode
smaller than a word are always performed on the entire register.
Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC machines do not.

<A NAME="IDX2125"></A>
<DT><CODE>LOAD_EXTEND_OP (<VAR>mode</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that read
memory in <VAR>mode</VAR>, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
bits outside of <VAR>mode</VAR> to be either the sign-extension or the
zero-extension of the data read.  Return <CODE>SIGN_EXTEND</CODE> for values
of <VAR>mode</VAR> for which the
insn sign-extends, <CODE>ZERO_EXTEND</CODE> for which it zero-extends, and
<CODE>NIL</CODE> for other modes.

This macro is not called with <VAR>mode</VAR> non-integral or with a width
greater than or equal to <CODE>BITS_PER_WORD</CODE>, so you may return any
value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always return
<CODE>NIL</CODE>.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will normally
define it as the constant <CODE>SIGN_EXTEND</CODE> or <CODE>ZERO_EXTEND</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2126"></A>
<DT><CODE>SHORT_IMMEDIATES_SIGN_EXTEND</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if loading short immediate values into registers sign
extends.

<A NAME="IDX2127"></A>
<DT><CODE>IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR</CODE>
<DD>
An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for conversion
of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
<CODE>FIX_ROUND_EXPR</CODE> is used.
<A NAME="IDX2128"></A>
<DT><CODE>FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly to an
unsigned one.

<A NAME="IDX2129"></A>
<DT><CODE>EASY_DIV_EXPR</CODE>
<DD>
An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
compile code for in the general case.  It may be
<CODE>TRUNC_DIV_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>FLOOR_DIV_EXPR</CODE>, <CODE>CEIL_DIV_EXPR</CODE> or
<CODE>ROUND_DIV_EXPR</CODE>.  These four division operators differ in how
they round the result to an integer.  <CODE>EASY_DIV_EXPR</CODE> is used
when it is permissible to use any of those kinds of division and the
choice should be made on the basis of efficiency.
<A NAME="IDX2130"></A>
<DT><CODE>MOVE_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move quickly
between memory and registers or between two memory locations.

<A NAME="IDX2131"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_MOVE_MAX</CODE>
<DD>
The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move quickly
between memory and registers or between two memory locations.  If this
is undefined, the default is <CODE>MOVE_MAX</CODE>.  Otherwise, it is the
constant value that is the largest value that <CODE>MOVE_MAX</CODE> can have
at run-time.

<A NAME="IDX2132"></A>
<DT><CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of bits
actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to the number
of bits needed to represent the size of the object being shifted.  When
this macro is non-zero, the compiler will assume that it is safe to omit
a sign-extend, zero-extend, and certain bitwise `and' instructions that
truncates the count of a shift operation.  On machines that have
instructions that act on bitfields at variable positions, which may
include `bit test' instructions, a nonzero <CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE>
also enables deletion of truncations of the values that serve as
arguments to bitfield instructions.

If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position bitfield
instructions exist, you should define this macro.

However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0, truncation
only applies to shift operations and not the (real or pretended)
bitfield operations.  Define <CODE>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</CODE> to be zero on
such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the <TT>`md'</TT> file that include
the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

You need not define this macro if it would always have the value of zero.

<A NAME="IDX2133"></A>
<DT><CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (<VAR>outprec</VAR>, <VAR>inprec</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
"convert" an integer of <VAR>inprec</VAR> bits to one of <VAR>outprec</VAR>
bits (where <VAR>outprec</VAR> is smaller than <VAR>inprec</VAR>) by merely
operating on it as if it had only <VAR>outprec</VAR> bits.

On many machines, this expression can be 1.

When <CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</CODE> returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
modes for which <CODE>MODES_TIEABLE_P</CODE> is 0, suboptimal code can result.
If this is the case, making <CODE>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</CODE> return 0 in
such cases may improve things.

<A NAME="IDX2134"></A>
<DT><CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison operator
with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag instruction
(<SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP>) when the condition is true.  This description must
apply to <EM>all</EM> the <SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> patterns and all the
comparison operators whose results have a <CODE>MODE_INT</CODE> mode.

A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is true
and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value indicates
which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the comparison is
true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the comparison
operation, which is given by the mode of the first operand in the
<SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign bit of
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> be on.  Presently, only those bits are used by
the compiler.

If <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they cause
the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are undefined.
For example, on a machine whose comparison operators return an
<CODE>SImode</CODE> value and where <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> is defined as
<SAMP>`0x80000000'</SAMP>, saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
expression


<PRE>
(ne:SI (and:SI <VAR>x</VAR> (const_int <VAR>power-of-2</VAR>)) (const_int 0))
</PRE>

can be converted to


<PRE>
(ashift:SI <VAR>x</VAR> (const_int <VAR>n</VAR>))
</PRE>

where <VAR>n</VAR> is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
tested into the sign bit.

There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the low-order bit
for a true value, but does not guarantee the value of any other bits,
but we do not know of any machine that has such an instruction.  If you
are trying to port GNU CC to such a machine, include an instruction to
perform a logical-and of the result with 1 in the pattern for the
comparison operators and let us know
(see section <A HREF="gcc_8.html#SEC138">How to Report Bugs</A>).

Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a value
from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules to guide the
choice of value for <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>, and hence the instructions
to be used:


<UL>
<LI>

Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
"normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for the
comparison operators to do so because there may be opportunities to
combine the normalization with other operations.

<LI>

For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1 being
slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and 1 preferred on
other machines.

<LI>

As a second choice, choose a value of <SAMP>`0x80000001'</SAMP> if instructions
exist that set both the sign and low-order bits but do not define the
others.

<LI>

Otherwise, use a value of <SAMP>`0x80000000'</SAMP>.
</UL>

Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
<CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> and its negation in the same number of
instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern for
those cases, e.g., one matching


<PRE>
(set <VAR>A</VAR> (neg:<VAR>m</VAR> (ne:<VAR>m</VAR> <VAR>B</VAR> <VAR>C</VAR>)))
</PRE>

Some machines can also perform <CODE>and</CODE> or <CODE>plus</CODE> operations on
condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
<SAMP>`s<VAR>cond</VAR>'</SAMP> insn followed by <CODE>and</CODE> or <CODE>plus</CODE>.  On those
machines, define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names <CODE>incscc</CODE>
and <CODE>decscc</CODE>, respectively, for the patterns which perform
<CODE>plus</CODE> or <CODE>minus</CODE> operations on condition code values.  See
<TT>`rs6000.md'</TT> for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to
find such instruction sequences on other machines.

You need not define <CODE>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE> if the machine has no store-flag
instructions.

<A NAME="IDX2135"></A>
<DT><CODE>FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are true.
Define this macro on machine that have comparison operations that return
floating-point values.  If there are no such operations, do not define
this macro.

<A NAME="IDX2136"></A>
<DT><CODE>Pmode</CODE>
<DD>
An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines, define
this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a hardware
pointer; <CODE>SImode</CODE> on 32-bit machine or <CODE>DImode</CODE> on 64-bit machines.
On some machines you must define this to be one of the partial integer
modes, such as <CODE>PSImode</CODE>.

The width of <CODE>Pmode</CODE> must be at least as large as the value of
<CODE>POINTER_SIZE</CODE>.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
<CODE>POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED</CODE> to specify how pointers are extended
to <CODE>Pmode</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2137"></A>
<DT><CODE>FUNCTION_MODE</CODE>
<DD>
An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to functions
being called, in <CODE>call</CODE> RTL expressions.  On most machines this
should be <CODE>QImode</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX2138"></A>
<DT><CODE>INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (<VAR>decl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which the
function <VAR>decl</VAR> should not be inlined.  <VAR>decl</VAR> is a
<CODE>FUNCTION_DECL</CODE> node.

The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number of
arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
threshold should be used on RISC machines.

<A NAME="IDX2139"></A>
<DT><CODE>SCCS_DIRECTIVE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this if the preprocessor should ignore <CODE>#sccs</CODE> directives
and print no error message.

<A NAME="IDX2140"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well as C.
This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header files in
C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are enclosed in
<SAMP>`extern "C" {...}'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX2141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2142"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2143"></A>
<DT><CODE>HANDLE_PRAGMA (<VAR>getc</VAR>, <VAR>ungetc</VAR>, <VAR>name</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If defined, it
is a C expression whose value is 1 if the pragma was handled by the
macro, zero otherwise.  The argument <VAR>getc</VAR> is a function of type
<SAMP>`int (*)(void)'</SAMP> which will return the next character in the input
stream, or EOF if no characters are left.  The argument <VAR>ungetc</VAR> is
a function of type <SAMP>`void (*)(int)'</SAMP> which will push a character back
into the input stream.  The argument <VAR>name</VAR> is the word following
#pragma in the input stream.  The input stream pointer will be pointing
just beyond the end of this word.  The input stream should be left
undistrubed if the expression returns zero, otherwise it should be
pointing at the next character after the end of the pragma.  Any
characters remaining on the line will be ignored.

It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of <CODE>#pragma</CODE>.  The
only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
compilers that do support <CODE>#pragma</CODE> for the sake of any user
programs which already use it.

If the pragma can be implemented by atttributes then the macro
<SAMP>`INSERT_ATTRIBUTES'</SAMP> might be a useful one to define as well.

Note: older versions of this macro only had two arguments: <VAR>stream</VAR>
and <VAR>token</VAR>.  The macro was changed in order to allow it to work
when gcc is built both with and without a cpp library.

<A NAME="IDX2144"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2145"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2146"></A>
<DT><CODE>HANDLE_SYSV_PRAGMA</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want the System V style
pragmas <SAMP>`#pragma pack(&#60;n&#62;)'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`#pragma weak &#60;name&#62;
[=&#60;value&#62;]'</SAMP> to be supported by gcc.

The pack pragma specifies the maximum alignment (in bytes) of fields
within a structure, in much the same way as the <SAMP>`__aligned__'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`__packed__'</SAMP> <CODE>__attribute__</CODE>s do.  A pack value of zero resets
the behaviour to the default.

The weak pragma only works if <CODE>SUPPORTS_WEAK</CODE> and
<CODE>ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL</CODE> are defined.  If enabled it allows the creation
of specifically named weak labels, optionally with a value.

<A NAME="IDX2147"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2148"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2149"></A>
<DT><CODE>HANDLE_PRAGMA_PACK_PUSH_POP</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro (to a value of 1) if you want to support the Win32
style pragmas <SAMP>`#pragma pack(push,&#60;n&#62;)'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`#pragma
pack(pop)'</SAMP>.  The pack(push,&#60;n&#62;) pragma specifies the maximum alignment
(in bytes) of fields within a structure, in much the same way as the
<SAMP>`__aligned__'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`__packed__'</SAMP> <CODE>__attribute__</CODE>s do.  A
pack value of zero resets the behaviour to the default.  Successive
invocations of this pragma cause the previous values to be stacked, so
that invocations of <SAMP>`#pragma pack(pop)'</SAMP> will return to the previous
value.

<A NAME="IDX2150"></A>
<DT><CODE>VALID_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTE (<VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>attributes</VAR>, <VAR>identifier</VAR>, <VAR>args</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if <VAR>identifier</VAR> with
arguments <VAR>args</VAR> is a valid machine specific attribute for <VAR>decl</VAR>.
The attributes in <VAR>attributes</VAR> have previously been assigned to <VAR>decl</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2151"></A>
<DT><CODE>VALID_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE (<VAR>type</VAR>, <VAR>attributes</VAR>, <VAR>identifier</VAR>, <VAR>args</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if <VAR>identifier</VAR> with
arguments <VAR>args</VAR> is a valid machine specific attribute for <VAR>type</VAR>.
The attributes in <VAR>attributes</VAR> have previously been assigned to <VAR>type</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2152"></A>
<DT><CODE>COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>type1</VAR>, <VAR>type2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C expression whose value is zero if the attributes on
<VAR>type1</VAR> and <VAR>type2</VAR> are incompatible, one if they are compatible,
and two if they are nearly compatible (which causes a warning to be
generated).

<A NAME="IDX2153"></A>
<DT><CODE>SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>type</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to
newly defined <VAR>type</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2154"></A>
<DT><CODE>MERGE_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>type1</VAR>, <VAR>type2</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the merging of type attributes needs special handling.
If defined, the result is a list of the combined TYPE_ATTRIBUTES of
<VAR>type1</VAR> and <VAR>type2</VAR>.  It is assumed that comptypes has already been
called and returned 1.

<A NAME="IDX2155"></A>
<DT><CODE>MERGE_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>olddecl</VAR>, <VAR>newdecl</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the merging of decl attributes needs special handling.
If defined, the result is a list of the combined DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of
<VAR>olddecl</VAR> and <VAR>newdecl</VAR>.  <VAR>newdecl</VAR> is a duplicate declaration
of <VAR>olddecl</VAR>.  Examples of when this is needed are when one attribute
overrides another, or when an attribute is nullified by a subsequent
definition.

<A NAME="IDX2156"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSERT_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>node</VAR>, <VAR>attr_ptr</VAR>, <VAR>prefix_ptr</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if you want to be able to add attributes to a decl
when it is being created.  This is normally useful for backends which
wish to implement a pragma by using the attributes which correspond to
the pragma's effect.  The <VAR>node</VAR> argument is the decl which is being
created.  The <VAR>attr_ptr</VAR> argument is a pointer to the attribute list
for this decl.  The <VAR>prefix_ptr</VAR> is a pointer to the list of
attributes that have appeared after the specifiers and modifiers of the
declaration, but before the declaration proper.

<A NAME="IDX2157"></A>
<DT><CODE>SET_DEFAULT_DECL_ATTRIBUTES (<VAR>decl</VAR>, <VAR>attributes</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to
newly defined <VAR>decl</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2158"></A>
<DT><CODE>DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro to control use of the character <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in identifier
names.  0 means <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> is not allowed by default; 1 means it is allowed.
1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro in that case.
This macro controls the compiler proper; it does not affect the preprocessor.

<A NAME="IDX2159"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
<SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
G++ have <SAMP>`$'</SAMP> in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined,
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> is used instead.

<A NAME="IDX2160"></A>
<DT><CODE>NO_DOT_IN_LABEL</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
<SAMP>`.'</SAMP> in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
have names that use <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>.  If this macro is defined, these names
are rewritten to avoid <SAMP>`.'</SAMP>.

<A NAME="IDX2161"></A>
<DT><CODE>DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if the target system expects every program's <CODE>main</CODE>
function to return a standard "success" value by default (if no other
value is explicitly returned).

The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to generate the
appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when compiling the end of
<CODE>main</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>HAVE_ATEXIT</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2162"></A>
Define this if the target system supports the function
<CODE>atexit</CODE> from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined,
and <CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> is not defined, a default
<CODE>exit</CODE> function will be provided to support C++.

<DT><CODE>EXIT_BODY</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2163"></A>
Define this if your <CODE>exit</CODE> function needs to do something
besides calling an external function <CODE>_cleanup</CODE> before
terminating with <CODE>_exit</CODE>.  The <CODE>EXIT_BODY</CODE> macro is
only needed if neither <CODE>HAVE_ATEXIT</CODE> nor
<CODE>INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP</CODE> are defined.

<A NAME="IDX2164"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (<VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe for the
delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay slot of <VAR>insn</VAR>,
even if they appear to use a resource set or clobbered in <VAR>insn</VAR>.
<VAR>insn</VAR> is always a <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> or an <CODE>insn</CODE>; GNU CC knows that
every <CODE>call_insn</CODE> has this behavior.  On machines where some <CODE>insn</CODE>
or <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> is really a function call and hence has this behavior,
you should define this macro.

You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

<A NAME="IDX2165"></A>
<DT><CODE>INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (<VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe for the
delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay slot of <VAR>insn</VAR>,
even if they appear to set or clobber a resource referenced in <VAR>insn</VAR>.
<VAR>insn</VAR> is always a <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> or an <CODE>insn</CODE>.  On machines where
some <CODE>insn</CODE> or <CODE>jump_insn</CODE> is really a function call and its operands
are registers whose use is actually in the subroutine it calls, you should
define this macro.  Doing so allows the delay slot scheduler to move
instructions which copy arguments into the argument registers into the delay
slot of <VAR>insn</VAR>.

You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

<A NAME="IDX2166"></A>
<DT><CODE>MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (<VAR>insn</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
In rare cases, correct code generation requires extra machine
dependent processing between the second jump optimization pass and
delayed branch scheduling.  On those machines, define this macro as a C
statement to act on the code starting at <VAR>insn</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2167"></A>
<DT><CODE>MULTIPLE_SYMBOL_SPACES</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro if in some cases global symbols from one translation
unit may not be bound to undefined symbols in another translation unit
without user intervention.  For instance, under Microsoft Windows
symbols must be explicitly imported from shared libraries (DLLs).

<A NAME="IDX2168"></A>
<DT><CODE>ISSUE_RATE</CODE>
<DD>
A C expression that returns how many instructions can be issued at the
same time if the machine is a superscalar machine.  This is only used by
the <SAMP>`Haifa'</SAMP> scheduler, and not the traditional scheduler.

<A NAME="IDX2169"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_SCHED_INIT (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>verbose</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement which is executed by the <SAMP>`Haifa'</SAMP> scheduler at the
beginning of each block of instructions that are to be scheduled.
<VAR>file</VAR> is either a null pointer, or a stdio stream to write any
debug output to.  <VAR>verbose</VAR> is the verbose level provided by
<SAMP>`-fsched-verbose-'</SAMP><VAR>n</VAR>.

<A NAME="IDX2170"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_SCHED_REORDER (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>verbose</VAR>, <VAR>ready</VAR>, <VAR>n_ready</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement which is executed by the <SAMP>`Haifa'</SAMP> scheduler after it
has scheduled the ready list to allow the machine description to reorder
it (for example to combine two small instructions together on
<SAMP>`VLIW'</SAMP> machines).  <VAR>file</VAR> is either a null pointer, or a stdio
stream to write any debug output to.  <VAR>verbose</VAR> is the verbose level
provided by <SAMP>`-fsched-verbose-'</SAMP><VAR>n</VAR>.  <VAR>ready</VAR> is a pointer to
the ready list of instructions that are ready to be scheduled.
<VAR>n_ready</VAR> is the number of elements in the ready list.  The
scheduler reads the ready list in reverse order, starting with
<VAR>ready</VAR>[<VAR>n_ready</VAR>-1] and going to <VAR>ready</VAR>[0].

<A NAME="IDX2171"></A>
<DT><CODE>MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE (<VAR>file</VAR>, <VAR>verbose</VAR>, <VAR>insn</VAR>, <VAR>more</VAR>)</CODE>
<DD>
A C statement which is executed by the <SAMP>`Haifa'</SAMP> scheduler after it
has scheduled an insn from the ready list.  <VAR>file</VAR> is either a null
pointer, or a stdio stream to write any debug output to.  <VAR>verbose</VAR>
is the verbose level provided by <SAMP>`-fsched-verbose-'</SAMP><VAR>n</VAR>.
<VAR>insn</VAR> is the instruction that was scheduled.  <VAR>more</VAR> is the
number of instructions that can be issued in the current cycle.  The
<SAMP>`MD_SCHED_VARIABLE_ISSUE'</SAMP> macro is responsible for updating the
value of <VAR>more</VAR> (typically by <VAR>more</VAR>--).

<A NAME="IDX2172"></A>
<DT><CODE>MAX_INTEGER_COMPUTATION_MODE</CODE>
<DD>
Define this to the largest integer machine mode which can be used for
operations other than load, store and copy operations.

You need only define this macro if the target holds values larger than
<CODE>word_mode</CODE> in general purpose registers.  Most targets should not define
this macro.

<A NAME="IDX2173"></A>
<DT><CODE>MATH_LIBRARY</CODE>
<DD>
Define this macro as a C string constant for the linker argument to link
in the system math library, or <SAMP>`""'</SAMP> if the target does not have a
separate math library.

You need only define this macro if the default of <SAMP>`"-lm"'</SAMP> is wrong.
